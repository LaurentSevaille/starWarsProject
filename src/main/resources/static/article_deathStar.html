                The <b>DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station,</b> also designated as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station and
                referred to as the <b>Ultimate Weapon</b> in early development stages and later as the Death Star I and the
                First Death Star, but simply referred to as the <b>Death Star</b> was a moon-sized, deep-space mobile
                battle
                station constructed by the Galactic Empire. It had been designed to fire a single planet-destroying
                superlaser powered by massive kyber crystals which would destroy any planet targeted. It was the pet
                project of Emperor Palpatine, Director Orson Callan Krennic, and its eventual commander Grand Moff
                Wilhuff Tarkin to expound the military philosophy of the aptly named Tarkin Doctrine.
                <br><br>
                Some of the earliest plans for a mobile, planet-destroying superweapon dated back millennia to the
                ancient Sith. Thousands of years later, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Geonosians,
                aligned with Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, designed the Ultimate Weapon in
                secret. After the fall of the Confederacy, construction of the Death Star was appropriated by the
                nascent Empire. It was built in orbit of Geonosis and supported by a complex logistical network of
                bases. The station, which took many years longer to complete than expected, was eventually moved from
                Geonosis to Scarif in its final stages of construction.
                <br><br>
                When the Alliance to Restore the Republic learned of the Death Star's existence, division emerged within
                Alliance leadership; some believed such a weapon too great a threat to justify continued insurrection
                and resistence, while others believed the Death Star was too great a threat to ignore, and must be
                destroyed. Ultimately, rogue operatives Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor led a mission, which the Rebel
                Alliance soon joined, to steal the battle station's design plans, as Erso had discovered that her
                father, who had been the primary engineer behind the project, had left a fatal flaw in the design, which
                could enable the Death Star to be destroyed with relative ease.
                <br><br>
                Having retrieved the Death Star plans from the Imperial Center of Military Research on Scarif, Erso was
                able to transmit them to the Rebel fleet above the planet, and they were recieved by Princess Leia
                Organa of Alderaan aboard the Tantive IV. Leia then fled through hyperspace toward Tatooine, where she
                was apprehended by Darth Vader, but not before having hidden the plans in her Astromech R2-D2. While the
                Princess was taken prisoner, her droid was able to escape and bring the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi, a
                former Jedi Knight living in hiding on Tatooine.
                <br><br>
                In an attempt to coerce Leia, now held captive on the battle station itself, into revealing the location
                of the Rebel Alliance's secret base, Governor Tarkin ordered the first full test of the Death Star,
                destroying the Princess' home planet of Alderaan. Shortly thereafter Leia managed to escape captivity on
                the Death Star with the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, who had been brought to Alderaan by
                pilots Han Solo and Chewbacca in an effort to reuinte the recovered Death Star plans to Leia's father
                and Rebel Alliance leader, Bail Organa.
                <br><br>
                Leia brought the plans to the Alliance leadership on Yavin 4, who quickly analyzed the data and
                discovered the design flaw deliberatly left in the battle station by Imperial engineer Galen Erso, which
                would allow a single proton torpedo, fired into the thermal exhaust port, to destroy the entire station.
                The Alliance launched a small assault against the Death Star, which had followed the escaping rebels to
                the Yavin system. The original Death Star was destroyed moments before opening fire on the moon by a
                shot fired by Rebel pilot Luke Skywalker with the aid of the Force. While Darth Vader escaped, due to
                having joined the dogfight above the station in his TIE fighter, many highranking Imperial officers
                perished aboard the space station, including Wilfuff Tarkin, Wullf Yularen, and Conan Motti.
                <br><br>
                The destruction of the Death Star weakened the Imperial Military, and Rebel assaults on Imperial
                installations prompted the construction of a second Death Star, both as a sign of defiance and
                technological terror. Despite this, it, like its predecessor, was destroyed with all hands lost. Decades
                later, the Empire's successor state, the First Order, constructed Starkiller Base, a much larger
                planet-destroying superweapon considered to be an evolution of the Death Star project of the Old Empire.

            The station was spheroid, and measured 160 km (100 miles) in diameter with 357 internal levels and a surface
            area of over 45,000 square kilometers. A large, concave dish in the northern hemisphere made up the
            superlaser emitter. The station's command bridge, the Overbridge, was located above the dish of the
            station's superlaser, within the Northern Polar Command Sector. The war room featured designated
            posts for Tarkin and other officers, a HoloNet booth for communicating with the Emperor, and large banks of
            viewscreens. Beside the bridge was the Death Star conference room, inbuilt with a circular table and twelve
            seats for high-ranking Imperial officers. The Emperor's tower and its throne room also fell within the
            Command Sector.
            <br><br>
            The station's equator comprised numerous docking ports of various sizes, all supported by the
            extraordinarily powerful tractor beam generator tower, which utilized several tractor-beam
            projectors and tractor-beam focusing shafts. The station's equator housed docking and hangar bays,
            tractor-beam generators, projectors, and emitter towers, turbolaser emplacements, and mooring platforms for
            ships of the fleet, including Imperial-class Star Destroyers.
            <br><br>
            A habitable crust several kilometers thick was composed of command centers, armories, maintenance blocks,
            and other requirements for a fully operational space station. Unused stories in the station's lower
            levels held backup weapons operators in the event of an emergency. Levels in the station's southern
            hemisphere extended downward through armories, deep storage, and a southern command sector. Massive girders
            provided grid-like support to the lower levels. Cranes and other abandoned construction material could still
            be found within the station by the time of its destruction in 0 BBY. With the exception of the crust, the
            station's entire interior space was uninhabited, and housed the hypermatter reactor, hyperdrive, 123 Kuat
            Drive Yards sublight engines, and the station's superweapon. The station's outer hull was made of
            quadanium steel plates.
            <br><br>
            The Death Star featured an entirely man-made atmosphere. A vast, central cylindrical atmosphere-processing
            unit ensured the air inside the station was regulated. Several modular artificial atmosphere
            stations and water-recycling tanks were dotted throughout the station's levels for the creation of air and
            humidity. Several large, cavernous airways served as means for circulation and as an emergency air dump in
            case of atmosphere contamination. A large, central airway existed for each sector. Magnetic seals and an
            atmosphere-containment projector kept the station's internal atmosphere in and the vacuum of space out if
            docking-bay doors were opened.

                The most prominent weapon emplacement on the Death Star was its superlaser — a weapon powered by a
                hypermatter annihilation reactor and focused through giant kyber crystals with sufficient
                firepower to destroy an entire planet. The hypermatter reactor at the center of the station fed
                energy into the various components of the superlaser, including the primary power amplifier, the
                superlaser power cell, the firing field amplifier, and the induction hyperphase generators. When firing,
                the energy was redirected into eight tributary beam shafts located around the perimeter of the
                superlaser, producing lasers that were converged using focusing coils, forming one large beam
                powerful enough to destroy a planet. If the firing-chamber arrays were not precisely aligned, the
                crystals would burn out and overload, sending dangerous levels of waste heat back into the Death Star's
                main reactor.
                <br><br>
                In addition to the Death Star's superlaser, its surface was peppered with 15,000 turbolaser batteries
                along with 768 tractor beam emplacements. As the station's defenses, these were installed in order to
                repel a large-scale fleet attack, rather than fend off individual starfighters, which the Empire viewed
                as no real threat. Shield projectors and communications arrays were distributed across the armored
                surface, analogous to colonies. A network of security stations were situated around the entire
                circumference and were equipped with holographic maps of the local region of space.
            </p>

            <h3 id="a1l3">Power</h3>
            <p>
                The station was powered by a cavernous hypermatter reactor encased in radiation insulator plating
                located at the center of the station,the destruction of which had the potential to be
                catastrophic to the station. Doonium and dolovite were essential for shielding the hypermatter
                reactor core, focusing dish, and superlaser. The reactor was connected to various components in the
                station, such as the superlaser, the power diversion solenoid, and the station's enormous power
                cells. The Death Star's tractor beam generator was also coupled to the main reactor through seven
                power generator terminals located throughout the station. Above the reactor were vast water
                tanks. The power of the Death Star's superlaser could be controlled depending on how many
                reactor ignitions were used to power it. For example, a single reactor ignition was capable of
                destroying a large area of a world's surface instead of destroying the body entirely.

            For all the power the Death Star held, Darth Sidious, the Emperor of the Galactic Empire, had a different
            view of the battle station, as he planned for it to serve as a constant reminder and tangible symbol of the
            dark side of the Force's power. With the Emperor freed from needing to portray this, he and his Sith
            apprentice, Darth Vader, would have devoted themselves to what Sidious dubbed "more pressing matters" which
            had little to do with his Empire and that only the two of them could investigate. Ultimately, Sidious wanted
            to have the power to reshape the universe to his design, a desire beyond mere immortality.

                given to Dooku, publicly the leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and secretly the Sith Lord
                Darth Tyranus, by Archduke Poggle the Lesser for safekeeping during the First Battle of Geonosis, in the
                waning decades of the Galactic Republic. Shortly after the battle, Dooku presented his Sith Master, Dark
                Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, and publicly Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic Sheev
                Palpatine, with the plans. During the war, Jedi General Aayla Secura and her astromech droid, QT-KT,
                came close to discovering the plans to the Death Star when the two inflitrated the Secret Research
                Facility on an unmapped moon. However, the assassin Asajj Ventress engaged in a lightsaber duel with
                Secura and stopped her.
                <br><br>
                The massive project was funded by a conglomerate of factions, including the Trade Federation, Muunilinst
                Banking Clan, the Techno Union, and covertly, the Republic itself. During later Republic
                interrogation, Geonosian leader Poggle the Lesser claimed that the schematics were merely presented to
                them by Dooku and that the Geonosians had simply refined them. Furthermore, he admitted that the
                Stalgasin hive hadn't had time to design the station's main weapon before the Battle of Geonosis
                interrupted development. Its design, centered on a superlaser array using massive kyber crystals, was
                inspired by technology developed by the ancient Sith.
                <br><br>
                By 21 BBY, the Republic Special Weapons Group developed plans for both an automated battlemoon asteroid
                and a torpedo siege platform, neither of which made it past the design stage. However, shortly after the
                Second Battle of Geonosis, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine presented the plans to the Republic Strategic
                Advisory Cell shortly after the battle in the cell's second briefing. Unaware that he was a Sith who
                had been given the plans by Dooku at the start of the war, those privy to its top-secret intel
                concluding that the plans for the Death Star must have fallen into Republic hands during or shortly
                after the battle. With the plans, Palpatine created the ploy that the Separatists were building their
                own superweapon, frightening Republic officials and allowing Palpatine to direct full funding towards
                secretly creating the station.
                <br><br>
                The Strategic Advisory Cell planned the construction of the Death Star and regularly met at the summit
                of the Strategic Planning Amphitheater of the Republic Center for Military Operations on Coruscant.
                There, a mixed-species gathering of 150 beings from prestigious and influential positions met to discuss
                progress on the battle station. The meetings included select senators; representatives from Corellian
                Engineering, Kuat Drive Yards, and Rendili StarDrive; key advisers; the chief of naval intelligence; the
                director of COMPOR; high-ranking members of the military; members of the War Production Board;
                structural engineers; starship designers; theoretical and experimental physicists; Dr. Gubacher; Prof.
                Sahali; Lieutenant Commander Orson Krennic; Vice Chancellor Mas Amedda; and Supreme Chancellor
                Palpatine. The Jedi were not invited to the meetings, nor did they even know about the project under
                construction over Geonosis.
                <br><br>
                All members involved in the construction of the battle station were required to sign the Official
                Secrets Oath. Near-unlimited funding was provided to the project owing to Republic fears that the
                Separatists had their own battle station under construction, which intelligence surmised was the reason
                Count Dooku failed to attack the station over Geonosis. Geonosian Leader Poggle the Lesser maintained
                his position that the Separatists had no project of their own in the works. Despite this, most cell
                members refused to take Poggle at his word and scoured the galaxy to locate the presumed construction
                site. While the evidence was specious, rejecting the possibility would have jeopardized Republic funding
                for the project, regardless of the authority ceded to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine by the Emergency
                Powers Act. Thus, Republic effort into constructing the battle station was viewed as a priority in order
                to beat the Separatists at their supposed own.
            </p>

            <h3 id="a2l2">Phase one completed</h3>
            <p>
                Funding for the project would have been viewed as spurious before the Clone Wars. However, as the war
                dragged on, more and more research firms were dragged into government contracts focusing on a different
                aspect of the space station, such as in shielding or power supply, and all unaware of what their
                research was ultimately for. Researchers involved in defense projects were required to sign the Official
                Secrets Oath. Initial construction on the Death Star had been carried out by newly designed machines,
                some of which were controlled by sentient operators stationed in orbital command habitats. A vast array
                of ships provided the station with metals, organic materials, and supplies of water. Viable asteroids
                were towed and tractor-beamed to the station from both around the planet and from fields surrounding the
                Geonosis system. Once mined, ores were sent to foundries in synchronous orbit for the production of
                durasteel and other metals.

                </figure>
                <br><br>
                Cannibalized droid factories built by Baktoid Armor on Geonosis's surface allowed additional foundries
                to go online soon after the start of asteroid mining. In 21 BBY, after the Second Battle of
                Geonosis and before the first anniversary of the First Battle of Geonosis, the Strategic Advisory Cell
                announced the completion of phase one of the Death Star's construction. The supports for the station's
                superstructure at one hundred and sixty kilometers from pole to pole had been completed. The next phase
                of construction revolved around the fabrication of a temporary equator, along with a series of
                longitudinal bands to roughly form the sphere. As the bands were secured, construction of the hull
                commenced, along with the partitioning of individual interior sections. The cabin spaces were to be
                clad, sealed, and pressurized in order to permit the use of sentient laborers in addition to droids.
                <br><br>
                Initial sentient labor estimates were in the millions. A Strategic Advisory Cell subcommittee considered
                providing the Kaminoans with a template to grow a labor force of clones adapted for deep-space work.
                Orson Krennic independently negotiated a deal with Poggle the Lesser: in return for his cooperation with
                the Republic, he would have his Geonosian workers begin construction on the facility. Instead of being
                punished, Krennic was given greater oversight over the project by Mas Amedda. After several months,
                workers had completed the station's false equator, with what Krennic described as looking like "an
                antique gyroscope" rather than an actual sphere. Following this achievement, several degrees of the
                upper hemisphere were outfitted with latitudinal structural members, and rudimentary layout work had
                begun on cladding a portion of the curved hull. Construction droids devoted themselves to fashioning the
                first interior spaces meant to serve as placeholders until actual cabin spaces could be bulkheaded. The
                Geonosians were the first organics planned to inhabit the life-support modules.

            <h3 id="a2l3">Imperial Era</h3>
            <p>
                The nascent Empire immediately appropriated the Ultimate Weapon project. Access to Geonosis was
                restricted to an inner circle of Imperial scientists and engineers, and very few members of the Imperial
                hierarchy even knew about the project. A highly secure supply line with various false routes and
                outposts was developed to ensure further secrecy, and it was during that time that the battle station
                was given the official name of Death Star and given the hull designation of DS-1, though the early
                codename, Stardust was still used in design files. Tiaan Jerjerrod, an architect and starship
                designer from Tinnel IV, was enlisted to help build the megaweapon. As construction continued under
                the Empire, Palpatine gave responsibility for the project to the Imperial Navy and charged Wilhuff
                Tarkin and Orson Krennic responsible for the battle station.
                <br><br>
                Despite construction moving ahead, not all Imperials believed in the viability of the project, with some
                voicing protest over what would later become known as "Tarkin's folly," and others not knowing of the
                project at all. General Jylia Shale was one of many who protested its development, only to result in her
                input being marginalized over the coming years. Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit opined that the Death
                Star might be able to serve for five, ten or even fifty years. However, he believed that eventually
                someone would figure out a way to disable or destroy it. Likewise, General Cassio Tagge believed
                that having the Death Star as the Empire's sole weapon was a mistake.
                <br><br>
                The Tarkin Initiative, an Imperial think tank, was responsible for some of the ideas behind both the
                first and second Death Stars. While many starship designers and engineers attempted to claim credit
                for the station's construction, none besides the Emperor knew the full history of the moon-sized
                project. While rumors within the Imperial ranks speculated that it was a Confederate weapon engineered
                by Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser's hive colony for Count Dooku, none could prove the story's
                validity. Some pointed out, however, that the plans must have fallen into Republic hands before the
                Clone Wars ended, owing to the station's shell and laser-focusing dish already in the works upon the
                war's conclusion.

                <br><br>
                Shortly after the proclamation of the New Order, Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader visited the station
                with Tarkin, arriving aboard a brand-new Imperial-class Star Destroyer. By this time, the focusing dish
                had been successfully installed. Orson Krennic believed that he was kept off the elite passenger list
                due to Poggle's recent escape under his supervision. Both Wilhuff Tarkin and Orson Krennic wished to
                attain control over the entire Death Star project. To further his interests, Krennic had been
                manipulating his longtime friend Galen Erso since the Clone Wars. By bringing him aboard Project
                Celestial Power, an Imperial research division unknowingly dedicated to weaponizing Galen's kyber
                crystal research, Krennic believed he would be given oversight over the Death Star and promoted to Rear
                Admiral. During that time, Krennic began appropriating legacy worlds—worlds legally exempt from
                exploitation—by using independent contractor Has Obitt to drop off weapons and war materiél on the
                worlds of Samovar, Wadi Raffa, and others for their reserves of doonium and dolovite. After
                "discovering" the weapons on the planets, Krennic appropriated them to prevent "Separatist holdouts"
                from attaining them.
                <br><br>
                Wilhuff Tarkin believed that Krennic's appropriation of planets without the Emperor's permission was a
                sign of his overreaching ambition, impulsiveness, and disdain for authority and the chain of command.
                Tarkin, like Krennic, believed that he should ultimately be made responsible for the Death Star project.
                Consequently, Tarkin planned to use Krennic as a convenient scapegoat for every construction delay and
                issue that was bound to plague the project, well aware that the Emperor was eyeing them both for a
                promotion. To avoid accepting the privilege prematurely, Tarkin continued to defer to Krennic until the
                proper time arose to oust him. Krennic also planned to keep Tarkin occupied. In 18 BBY,
                Krennic orchestrated an insurgency within the Salient system, aware that Tarkin, unable to retreat,
                would be caught in a weeks-long battle, lowering his favor with the Emperor.
                <br><br>
                Early attempts at test-firing the Death Star's superlaser led to the destruction of an entire city on
                Malpaz. The first successful test firing occurred much later at an isolated black-hole binary known as
                the Hero Twins. Preliminary scans indicated that the energy released during the test-fire had the
                destructive fire of the combined batteries of a qaz-class Star Destroyer. The superlaser was fired by a
                kyber crystal-assisted twin laser array carefully assembled and calibrated on Hypori, and installed on
                an Imperial-class Star Destroyer appropriated by the Special Weapons Group. Grand Vizier Mas Amedda
                wished the test firing to occur closer to the Core, but Krennic urged caution, knowing that a misfire
                would most likely result in the destruction of the ship. As a result of the successful test firing,
                Krennic was promoted to full commander.
                <br><br>
                For over a year, Galen Erso was employed in Project Celestial Power and was given nearly unlimited
                supplies of kyber crystals looted from Jedi Temples and lightsabers. Imperial research groups under
                Celestial Power were given codenames, such as Pax Aurora, Mark Omega, and Stellar Sphere. Almost all
                research divisions relied on research conducted by Galen Erso, who had an intricate knowledge of
                crystallography. Galen believed that his research was intended to repair worlds devastated by the Clone
                Wars by providing inexpensive power to civilian populations. Eventually, Galen, suspicious at the lack
                of information provided to him by Krennic regarding the implementation of his research, discovered that
                his work was being weaponized without his knowledge. Angered, Galen, his wife, and daughter, Jyn Erso,
                escaped the Celestial Power facility on Coruscant with infamous rebel Saw Gerrera. The Erso family moved
                to Lah'mu, hopeful that Krennic—who was demoted to lieutenant commander for Erso's escape and enraged
                his former friend chose pacifism over the fame the battle station would give him—would not find them.
                Tarkin was then given oversight of Sentinel Base and the Death Star project.

            <h3 id="a2l4">Completion at long last</h3>
            <p>
                One member of Project Stardust, Assistant Director Brierly Ronan, believed that the Death Star's
                completion would make the rest of the political structure on the Imperial capital of Coruscant entirely
                irrelevant. Instead, Ronan believed Emperor Palpatine and Director Krennic would be the only ones who
                mattered. However, Lieutenant Eli Vanto, a former commander in the Imperial Navy and current member of
                the Chiss Ascendancy, felt Palpatine could emerge as the sole important figure, though Ronan refused to
                believe his superior would be swept away.
                <br><br>
                Having taken much longer than expected to develop, the massive construction project was finally
                completed almost twenty years after its conception during the Clone Wars, and at some point was
                rechristened as the Death Star. Imperial Navy pilots and military personnel were eventually assigned to
                the station shortly before it was revealed to the public, being new enough to still be labeled as
                classified. After extracting the last of the kyber crystals from the ancient Temple of the Kyber, in
                Jedha City, Krennic told Tarkin that the station was ready and prepared to destroy a planet, but Tarkin
                wasn't confident in the power of the station yet, and ordered that only Jedha City be destroyed. Using
                minimal power of the superlaser, the order was carried out and Jedha City, along with miles of
                surrounding terrain were destroyed, including the hideout of Saw Gerrera's extremist group. However, Jyn
                Erso saw a message from her father, the scientist Galen Erso, that the Death Star had a fatal flaw which
                he installed.
            </p>

            <h3 id="a2l5">Scarif and Alderaan</h3>
            <p>
                Erso and her companions delivered the news of the weakness in the Death Star to the Alliance to Restore
                the Republic. Unable to reach a consensus on how to respond to the new threat, the squad team, Rogue
                One, infiltrated Scarif to steal the plans, which were transferred before the Death Star was used to
                destroy the Imperial base. With the mission a success, the technical readouts of the battle station
                were received by Imperial senator and rebel sympathizer Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, who intended
                to pass them along to her allies. However, before she could do so, the blockade runner she was aboard
                was intercepted by Imperial forces commanded by Darth Vader, and she was captured, but not before she
                passed the plans to the astromech droid R2-D2 and sent him with the protocol droid C-3PO in an escape
                pod to the planet below. Meanwhile, Tarkin arranged for a fake weapons test of the Death Star
                against the primitive planet Rango Tan as a means of testing how willing the gunner crew was to fire.

                As a high-value prisoner, Organa was moved to Cell 2187 of Detention Block AA-23, sub-level five, where
                she was interrogated in order to learn the location of the Rebellion's secret base. Faced with her
                considerable resistance to Imperial interrogation techniques, Tarkin opted to try a different approach:
                intimidation. In a move calculated to force Organa to reveal the Rebel base, Tarkin threatened to use
                the station's primary weapon to destroy her homeworld. Though she ostensibly relented and supplied the
                Rebel base's location as Dantooine, Tarkin ordered the attack to move forward in order to demonstrate
                the military power that the Empire now held. Alderaan was the perfect target to show no planet was above
                destruction at the hands of the Death Star. Tarkin had also noticed Chief Gunner Endo Frant had not
                wanted to fire on his homeworld and intended to root out that weakness. In a matter of moments, the
                Death Star destroyed the planet Alderaan, leaving no survivors. Nearly all forces on the Death Star
                were ordered to witness the destruction, including Iden Versio, a Senior Lieutenant in the Imperial
                Navy.
                <br><br>
                Immediately after the planet's destruction, the Star Destroyer Devastator left the station, and a small
                Imperial force was sent to investigate Leia's claim under the command of General Cassio Tagge. Upon
                arrival in the system, however, it was discovered that the base was abandoned. When they refused to
                apologize for hesitating, Tarkin also had Frant and every other gunner who hesitated at firing on
                Alderaan killed. Upon learning the Rebel base on Dantooine was abandoned, Tarkin, angered by her
                lie, ordered Organa's execution, although Vader convinced him to allow her to be rescued by a group of
                outlaws, in order to follow them back to the Rebel base themselves. Imperial Professor Thlu-Ry was also
                present on the space station, helping with its final alignment tests before departing.

            <h3 id="a2l6">Destruction</h3>
            <p>
                The Death Star pursued Organa and her allies to the Yavin system, where the Rebel base was located on
                Yavin 4. With R2-D2 having supplied them with the technical readouts of the Death Star, the Rebels
                identified a weakness in the station's design and prepared their starfighters for a desperate attempt to
                destroy the station before it could bring its weapon to bear on Yavin 4. The plan, as explained by
                Alliance tactician Jan Dodonna, called for the firing of proton torpedoes down a two-meter-wide thermal
                exhaust port in the station's meridian trench. The shaft led straight to the station's main reactor,
                where the flaw left by Galen Erso would start a chain reaction that could destroy the station. Owing to
                the Death Star's design philosophy focusing on defense against large-scale attacks, the exhaust port was
                relatively unguarded.

                While the battle initially appeared in the Alliance's favor owing to the small size of the Rebel
                ships—granting them the ability to dodge turbolaser fire—the launch of numerous TIE fighters under the
                personal command of Lord Vader in his TIE Advanced x1 destroyed the majority of the Rebel vessels, but
                ultimately one proved successful. Piloted by Tatooine native Luke Skywalker, his T-65B X-wing
                starfighter managed to fire a pair of proton torpedoes down the thermal exhaust port. The torpedoes
                destroyed the Death Star's main reactor by causing a chain reaction as predicted, resulting in the
                destruction of the Empire's prestigious weapon.

                Where there were once thousands of communications streaming in endless waves from the Death Star, in a
                mere instant there were none. In the chaotic hours that followed the station's destruction, multiple
                rumors of the station's defeat circulated across the galaxy, while a Gozanti-class cruiser piloted by
                Ciena Ree and Berisse Sai was sent to the Yavin system to both confirm the Empire's worst fears and pick
                up Lord Vader, who was trapped inside his TIE Advanced x1.
                <br><br>
                The Rebels, after a brief celebration, immediately began evacuating their base to avoid the inevitable
                Imperial reprisal against the station's destruction.

                With the loss of Grand Moff Tarkin, numerous members of the Joint Chiefs and Imperial Military manpower,
                the Empire began to mobilize for a full-scale galactic war, while it also forged ahead and began
                construction on the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. The Imperial HoloNet subsequently
                downplayed the destruction of the Empire's ultimate weapon, referring to it only as an "unprecedented
                attack by the Rebel Alliance" while bringing attention to the fact that the Empire had the means to
                destroy an entire planet in order to strike fear into those who might question the Emperor's
                rule. In addition, Lord Vader would send pieces of Alderaan as state gifts to seditious worlds
                needing to be disciplined.
                <br><br>
                Despite attempts to devalue the Rebel victory, Imperial statisticians noted a predictable increase in
                pirate and dissident activity following the loss of such a prestigious weapon. Seeking to punish
                those responsible for the station's destruction, the Emperor began a culling at the highest ranks of the
                Empire, executing officials, such as Moff Coovern and Minister Khemt, believing that their incompetence
                was partly to blame for the station's annihilation. As a result, General Cassio Tagge was promoted
                to the newly created rank of Grand General and given the majority of the powers Tarkin once held, mainly
                due to his ability to question the invulnerability of the battle station. To Tagge, the Death Star
                project had been misguided from the start. A strong proponent of the Imperial Navy, Tagge believed that
                future plans could not be based around an individual asset such as the Death Star, but should instead
                utilize those assets as a force multiplier, not as a be-all end-all solution to a problem. The Emperor
                placed his trust in Tagge's new strategy until the second Death Star could be completed.
                <br><br>
                In 5 ABY, debris from the Death Star that was collected by the New Republic was given to the Alderaan
                Flotilla as a gift from Princess Leia Organa to use to build a space station over the ruins of Alderaan.
                The former plan was to scrap the debris, but Leia used her political connections to see that it was put
                to good use.
                <br><br>
                The design flaw leading to the destruction of the Death Star never became widely known to the public.
                Though some correctly speculated that the Emperor had been betrayed by someone on the inside, the public
                story remained that of Luke Skywalker's shot in a single starfighter.
