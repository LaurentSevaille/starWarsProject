        <p>
            <b> Luke Skywalker</b>, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the
            Galactic
            Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and
            General Han Solo, Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore the
            Republic—an
            organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy.
            Following
            the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic
            history.
        </p>

        <p>
            The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with
            his
            twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the
            Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family
            of
            Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and
            purpose,
            Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi
            Master
            Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY,
            Skywalker
            saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death
            Star.
            He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father
            before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker
            participated in
            the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was
            in
            fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by
            killing Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen
            One. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on Ajan
            Kloss,
            but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her
            knighthood.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker
            traveled
            across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. In 9 ABY,
            Skywalker temporarily took on Grogu, a Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same species as Yoda,
            as
            an apprentice. However, during Grogu's training, Skywalker sensed that the child's heart wasn't into
            relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu's friend, the Mandalorian Din Djarin visited the planet bearing a
            gift
            of chain mail armor for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice: accepting the gift and returning to
            the
            Mandalorian, or taking Yoda's lightsaber and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to
            Djarin.
        </p>

        <p>
            Skywalker later took his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength
            and
            potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. As Master and Padawan, Skywalker traveled with his
            nephew
            and battled the Knights of Ren, studied lost Jedi lore, and gathered others to expand their new order's
            ranks. In 28 ABY, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in his nephew, briefly contemplated killing him,
            causing
            Solo to fall to the dark side like Vader before him and destroy his nascent order. The loss of his
            nephew
            haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. The destruction of his temple and the deaths of all his
            students
            convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world
            of
            Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy's pleas for help
            during the rise of the First Order.
        </p>

        <p>
            His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain
            of
            events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness.
            Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a
            spark of
            hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would
            not
            die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>
            Luke Skywalker was born in 19 BBY on the asteroid field of Polis Massa two days after the proclamation
            of the Galactic Empire. He and his twin sister, Leia, who was born minutes after him, are the children
            of Galactic Republic
            Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after the births, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had
            recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and their father,
            the now-Sith Lord Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi personally sent the infant Luke to be raised by Anakin's
            stepbrother, Owen Lars and his wife, Beru on the planet Tatooine, while Senator Bail Organa agreed to
            adopt Leia together with his wife, the queen of Alderaan.
            <br><br>
            Luke Skywalker spent his youth on the Lars' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to
            discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been "a navigator on a spice
            freighter" during the Clone Wars. His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle
            had business in Mos Eisley, she took Skywalker to Anchorhead to use the HoloNet connections there and
            show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.
            <br><br>
            By the age of three in 16 BBY, Skywalker had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built
            especially for him. He did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving
            several of them at his grandmother, Shmi's sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as
            Skywalker played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been
            watching him from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the
            realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by
            one of the gang, Skywalker threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the
            Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further,
            slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included Owen Lars, who managed to gun down several
            of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a Devaronian,
            had snuck up behind Lars, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last
            marauder in half. As Skywalker cheered, Lars threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Lars then
            ushered Skywalker back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that
            Skywalker's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father's natural piloting
            skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine. At one point in his boyhood, Skywalker was
            climbing in a canyon, but, when he grabbed the top, the rock broke off. Skywalker fell into a cave,
            where he was seen by a group of womp rats and a krayt dragon, although he managed to escape the
            creatures. Years later, C-3PO referenced this story to several visitors. When Skywalker was 12 years
            old in 7 BBY, he and his friend, Windy went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and
            wandered away from the moisture farms riding a dewback. The two encountered a sandstorm during their
            time outside and both lost consciousness. A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they
            were saved by Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to the Lars family. Skywalker
            asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father.
            Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.

        <h3>Joining the Rebellion</h3>
        <h4>Leaving Tattooine</h4>
        <p>
            In 0 BBY, Skywalker was working on the family farm by repairing moisture vaporators with one of their
            WED Treadwell repair droid when he spotted a battle over Tatooine; unknown to the young man, it was the
            Rebel starship Tantive IV being chased by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. Heading to
            Tosche Station, Skywalker swapped stories with his friends, among them a visiting and recently-graduated
            Darklighter, who was reluctant to believe Skywalker's claims about a battle upon looking up with
            Skywalker's macrobinoculars and merely seeing the two craft sitting still in space. Nonetheless,
            Skywalker was then eager to tell his friend of his recent exploits aboard his skyhopper in Beggar's
            Canyon, which Darklighter was amused by. After warning his friend not to crash the ship, he leaned close
            to Skywalker to tell his old friend a great secret: he intended to defect from the Empire to join the
            Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps.
            <br><br>
            Promising to keep an eye out for him, Darklighter and Skywalker then parted ways once again with the
            hope that they could reunite one day. A short time later, the purchase of two droids—R2-D2 and
            C-3PO—by Skywalker's step-uncle changed the young farm boy's life forever. Obtaining the droids from a
            band of Jawas to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the
            droids had narrowly escaped from the battle Skywalker had glimpsed, and that R2-D2 contained a
            set of plans for the Empire's dreaded Death Star superweapon. While cleaning the two new droids back at
            the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part
            of a desperate message from Princess Leia Organa requesting help from someone named "Obi-Wan Kenobi,"
            whom R2-D2 claimed that he once belonged to.
            <br><br>
            Chasing after R2-D2 when the droid ran off to find Kenobi, Skywalker soon found himself in the company
            of Kenobi after being attacked by a group of Sand People out in the Jundland Wastes. After traveling
            back to the Jedi's home, Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a Jedi Knight who
            served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker's father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not
            a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Darth
            Vader. Skywalker was also given his father's lightsaber by Kenobi, allowing the blade to be ignited for
            the first time in years. After he showed Princess Leia's message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old
            Jedi Master requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of
            the Force. Skywalker initially refused to get involved, as he believed his duties at home were more
            important, but he offered to take Kenobi to Anchorhead.
            <br> <br>
            On their way to Anchorhead, Skywalker and Kenobi came upon a group of slaughtered Jawas—the same ones
            who sold the droids to his uncle. Skywalker deduced from learning that Imperial stormtroopers were
            responsible that they might have looked into the sales records of the droids, and rushed home in the
            hopes of saving his step-aunt and step-uncle. Upon returning home, Skywalker discovered that he was too
            late: his step-aunt and step-uncle had been murdered by the Empire. With the people who raised him dead,
            he decided to accompany Kenobi to Alderaan to deliver the plans back to the Alliance and learn the ways
            of the Jedi.
        </p>
        <h4>Jedi training</h4>
        <p>
            On their way to Mos Eisley, Kenobi began training him and gave Skywalker his first lesson, during which
            he learned the basics of Jedi meditation. They would later reach Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, where
            Kenobi believed that they could find a pilot that could get them to Alderaan. Inside the cantina,
            Skywalker nearly had a fatal run-in with the criminals Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan, but trouble was
            avoided when Kenobi sliced off Baba's arm with his lightsaber in defense of Skywalker.
            <br><br>
            The two were eventually able to find a pilot that could take them to Alderaan in the form of Han Solo, a
            Corellian smuggler, and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Solo's initial rate was ten thousand credits all paid in
            advance, which Skywalker thought was too expensive. Ultimately, they were able to compromise when Kenobi
            offered to pay two thousand credits up front and an additional fifteen thousand when they got to
            Alderaan, for a total of seventeen thousand credits, which convinced Solo to take them, with Skywalker
            selling his speeder to pay for the two thousand up front. As they left the cantina, they were also
            cornered by a stormtrooper, but Kenobi took out the trooper with the Force by throwing large pieces of
            metal. With it clear that stormtroopers were all around the city, the two moved to quickly depart Mos
            Eisley.
            <br><br>
            After escaping stormtroopers on Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon, Kenobi began Skywalker's instruction
            in the ways of the Force, using a training remote to instruct him in basic lightsaber combat, much to
            the derision of Solo, who dismissed it as a "hokey religion." Wearing a helmet that completely
            covered his eyes for part of the lesson, Kenobi encouraged him to reach out with the Force to combat the
            remote. Despite his vision being totally impaired, Skywalker was able to successfully deflect a pair of
            blaster bolts from the remote, claiming that he could "almost see" the remote through the Force.
        </p>
        <h4>Death Star rescue</h4>
        <p>
            The lesson, however, was soon interrupted by their arrival in the Alderaan system and their discovery of
            the planet's destruction. They then spotted a patrolling TIE fighter and, upon following it, found that
            it was approaching what appeared to be a small moon, which turned out to be the Death Star. Caught by
            the Death Star's tractor beam, they were brought aboard the massive space station.
            <br><br>
            Once on board, Luke and Han knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out
            to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when R2-D2 discovered that Leia Organa was being held captive
            on the station, Skywalker insisted on rescuing her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the
            detention block, Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he'd get a
            significant reward for doing so.
            <br><br>
            Still using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Chewbacca to pose as a prisoner and
            escorted him to Detention Block AA-23 (where Organa was being held.) They were able to rescue Organa,
            but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the garbage compactor in order to escape the
            pursuing Imperial forces. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Chewbacca, they were
            able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with
            Darth Vader. Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief. Despite the fact that
            they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to
            them, so at Solo's request, Skywalker manned one of the Millennium Falcon's quad laser cannons to
            eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was
            eliminated, they traveled to the hidden rebel base on Yavin 4, unaware that the Death Star was tracking
            them.
        </p>
        <h4>Battle of Yavin</h4>
        <p>
            Upon their arrival at the Yavin base, they met with Commander Willard and Organa introduced him to
            Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a pilot. Skywalker then separated and met Wedge
            Antilles, who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 seconds, the more experienced
            pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second
            try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of
            Antilles's, prompting Willard to accept him without objection. He joined Red Group with the
            designation of Red Five,which had previously belonged to a cadet named Pedrin Gaul, who had
            perished during the Battle of Scarif several days earlier.
            <br><br>
            After the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself
            for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the Falcon for rescuing Organa and prepared to
            leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo
            refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply
            disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well, Skywalker was about to board his T-65B
            X-wing starfighter, when he encountered his old friend Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as
            wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Luke that the two would
            catch up on each other's stories when they got back. Skywalker was also approached by Garven Dreis, the
            commander of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter
            vouched for his friend, calling him the "best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories." Skywalker was
            assigned command of fourth flight for the battle.
            <br><br>
            As the Battle of Yavin got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space,
            Skywalker was guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He participated in Red Squadron's initial assault
            on the Death Star's outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station's numerous turbolaser
            batteries and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also
            helped to provide cover for Gold Squadron when they made the first attack run on the meridian trench, as
            well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Darth Vader himself joined the fray in
            a TIE Advanced x1 and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by
            the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with
            Darklighter and Antilles.
            <br><br>
            Skywalker took charge of the last attempt on the thermal exhaust port as instructed, but Vader and his
            two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter
            suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen
            friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who
            urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter's targeting
            computer, much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface
            of Yavin 4.
            <br><br>
            Just as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like
            he had the other pilots, but before he could, Han Solo and Chewbacca showed up in the Millennium Falcon,
            destroying Vader's two escorts and causing Vader's TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the
            trench. At Solo's urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two proton torpedos, using the Force to
            guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he,
            Chewbacca, and Han Solo were awarded the Medal of Bravery the next morning.
            <br><br>
            Just as the ceremony ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of
            her family and homeworld. Afterwards, General Jan Dodonna sent him and Antilles, the only other survivor
            of Red Group, in their X-wings to retrieve the wayward princess and bring her to the Great Temple. Her
            shuttle's pilot, Evaan Verlaine, however, managed to outsmart them and make the jump to hyperspace with
            course to Naboo, with R2-D2 accompanying the two women. They would later reunite after she had
            successfully accomplished her mission. Soon after, Skywalker became an officer in the Alliance and
            was given the rank of Lieutenant and was regularly assigned numerous independent missions.
        </p>

        <h3>Traveling to Dagobah</h3>
        <p>
            Skywalker then traveled to Dagobah, which turned out to be a remote swamp planet, where he encountered
            Yoda, the former Grand Master of the fallen Jedi Order. In their initial meeting, Skywalker was
            frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Yoda, who did not initially
            identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker's patience, telling him a story about three
            brothers, and taking him back to his hut to partake in a meal of rootleaf stew, which he did not
            find very appetizing.
            <br><br>
            However, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Yoda
            agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi's spirit. Skywalker's training proved to be
            difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.
            <br><br>
            Skywalker's training on Dagobah lasted several weeks, with Kenobi needing to appear in Yoda's dreams
            more than once to convince the old master to keep up Luke's training and argue that the boy would not
            end up like this father. When Skywalker and Yoda argued, Kenobi also regularly appeared to stop their
            arguments. One day during his training with Yoda, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use
            his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Yoda
            decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.
            <br><br>
            When Yoda asked him to enter a cave that was strong in the dark side in which he was supposed to find
            only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing the armor of Darth Vader,
            meant to symbolize his inner darkness.
            <br><br>
            Shortly after, he had a vision of Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering at Cloud City on Bespin. Unable to
            get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help
            them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Yoda and Kenobi's
            insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that
            he'd learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy
            of the Empire.
            <br><br>
            Seeing that Skywalker's mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could
            not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Yoda advised him to mind
            what he'd learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his
            training.
        </p>

        <h3>Vader's revelation</h3>
        <p>
            Upon his arrival at Cloud City's East Platform, Skywalker felt Vader's presence, and went into the
            nearest building, where he was shot at by Fett, who had come to claim a bounty put on Solo by Jabba the
            Hutt, and tried to pursue a group of stormtroopers and Imperial officers who held Organa, Chewbacca, and
            C-3PO captive. The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path
            was diverted to the carbon-freezing chamber where Darth Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze
            him in carbonite to present him to the Emperor. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce lightsaber
            duel.
            <br><br>
            During the duel, Vader praised Skywalker's training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into
            giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to
            knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but
            Skywalker leapt out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.
            <br><br>
            The duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City's gas-processing vanes. Vader
            began using the Force to throw various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such
            projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation
            port. The chamber was quickly depressurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk
            overlooking the reactor shaft. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk's railing and pull himself
            up.
            <br><br>
            Vader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was
            weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed as Obi-Wan Kenobi had
            been. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with
            several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off
            his right hand. Both Skywalker's hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.
            <br><br>
            Seeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of
            the dark side and complete his training, but Skywalker adamantly refused to ever join Vader, the man who
            had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that <i>he</i> was his father.
            <br><br>
            Horrified by Vader's shocking revelation, Skywalker initially denounced the Sith Lord's claim as untrue
            and impossible, but Vader insisted that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader further claimed that
            Skywalker was powerful enough to destroy the Emperor, and when he did, they could rule the galaxy
            together as father and son. Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took
            the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through
            several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to
            grab onto a weather vane to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever,
            especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in
            desperation, he called out to Leia Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.
            <br><br>
            Soon, the Millennium Falcon, with Lando Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids onboard, arrived
            to rescue him. As they escaped from Bespin, and the Falcon was faced with the Imperial fleet, Vader
            reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him "son." Skywalker fought tears back, after
            hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the
            truth, just as the Falcon made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2.
        </p>

        <h4>Haunted by the truth</h4>
        <p>
            Haunted by the truth of his parentage, Skywalker found his connection to the Force considerably
            weakened, with his control over it remaining sporadic. Aboard the Falcon, Organa informed him of what
            had happened to Solo. Skywalker wanted to begin searching for his friend immediately, but Organa told
            him that there was more at stake than just Solo's life and it would be best to reconvene with the Rebel
            fleet first. With Skywalker agreeing to this plan, the Falcon jumped to hyperspace.
            <br><br>
            The Falcon arrived at the Rebellion's Rendezvous Point Delta-Three in the Mid Rim to find the fleet's
            Fourth Division under attack from several Star Destroyers, including the Tarkin's Will, which was under
            the leadership of Commander Ellian Zahra. As the Falcon entered the battle, Skywalker volunteered to
            commandeer the ship's belly gun, despite his injuries. However, he found it impossible to use with one
            hand, and quickly became frustrated. His anger resulted in him unknowingly using the Force to make
            several of the attacking TIE Fighters crash into one another. With Luke stunned by his sudden show of
            strength, the fleet jumped to hyperspace.
            <br><br>
            With the fleet regrouped, Skywalker found a deserted part of the flagship and attempted to contact Yoda
            through the Force. Angry at the Jedi Master's refusal to answer, he almost shattered one of the ship's
            windows in another frustration-fueled loss of control over his Force abilities. He wondered whether the
            lack of answers from his mentors signified a premature end to his Jedi training, and who he was meant to
            be if not a Jedi.
            <br><br>
            Organa told Skywalker that he should have a prosthetic hand installed in the Nebulon-B frigate
            Redemption's medbay. Although unsure whether it would help his mental state, Skywalker agreed, and
            received the hand as Calrissian and Chewbacca set out to find Solo.
        </p>

        <h3>The last of the Jedi</h3>
        <h4>Solo Rescue</h4>
        <p>
            In 4 ABY, Skywalker set in motion the plan to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt due to their failure
            to do so during the Attack on the Executor. Once again, Skywalker returned to Tatooine, and to
            Kenobi's hut, wherein he found the missing parts he needed for the construction of his own lightsaber,
            the pieces left to him by Kenobi. While his friends bustled about preparing for the rescue, Skywalker
            retreated into the solitude of a desert cave they had chosen as their rendezvous point. Using the Force
            to assemble the weapon, he brought the kyber crystal inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost
            an extension of himself.
            <br><br>
            Afterwards, Skywalker waited to see if Organa's impersonation of Boushh and liberation of Solo was
            successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to
            Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to
            Jabba's Palace. Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba's Gamorrean guards
            and his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, but the Hutt was not so easily swayed and attempted to feed Skywalker to
            his rancor, which Luke later killed, upsetting Malakili, the Rancor's keeper.
            <br><br>
            Skywalker killed the monster, but Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance
            heroes–including an unfrozen Solo–to death in the Great Pit of Carkoon to be eaten by the sarlacc that
            resided there. However, right before he was put into the pit, Skywalker escaped when R2-D2 shot his
            lightsaber to him and freed the other prisoners on the skiff. A skirmish ensued in which Skywalker
            protected his friends, ending the life of several of Jabba's thugs—including Klaatu and Nysad,
            who shot his cyborg hand during the skirmish—and helping Organa escape the Khetanna after she had killed
            the Hutt. After destroying the sail barge, Skywalker and his entire team escaped unscathed through a
            dangerous sandstorm, after which he boarded his X-Wing with R2-D2 and parted ways with the others.
        </p>
        <h4>Keeping the promise</h4>
        <p>
            Skywalker then returned to Dagobah to complete his training and keep the promise he had made to
            Yoda, but the aged Jedi Master, who had used the Force to prolong his life beyond what was natural,
            had fallen ill and was finally starting to succumb to age. Yoda told Skywalker that he'd already
            completed all the training he required, but in order to finally become a true Jedi, he needed to
            confront Darth Vader one more time. Having grown less and less sure since the revelation,
            Skywalker feared that it was the truth, Skywalker inquired if Vader was truly his father.
            <br> <br>
            Skywalker received such confirmation from Yoda, which angered him that they had lied to him for so long,
            but Yoda confessed that he knew that Skywalker
            had not been ready to shoulder the burden of being the child of the Dark Lord of the Sith, to which
            Skywalker expressed his regret that he did not listen to him the first time. After warning him not
            to underestimate the Emperor's powers or allow the dark side to take hold of him, and that as "the last
            of the Jedi" he had to pass on what he had learned, Yoda made one final revelation to Skywalker before
            he became one with the Force—that there was "another Skywalker."
            <br><br>
            Sensing his turmoil, the spirit of Kenobi appeared before Skywalker, who confronted him for lying about
            his father. Claiming that the good man that Anakin Skywalker had been had died upon his fall to the dark
            side, Kenobi stated that he did not directly lie to him about his father; he was simply telling him what
            happened "from a certain point of view." Skywalker voiced his belief that there was still good within
            his father, and that he could not bring himself to kill him, but Kenobi insisted that he needed to face
            him again in order to restore balance to the Force. Skywalker then asked about the "other Skywalker,"
            who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect
            them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was
            Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi. Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother's
            identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew
            Skywalker carried too many burdens already.
        </p>
        <h4>Adventure on the moon</h4>
        <p>
            Skywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested moon of Endor to destroy
            the shield generator that protected the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit, volunteering
            immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above Sullust. As they approached the moon on the stolen
            Lambda-class Imperial shuttle Tydirium, Skywalker sensed Vader's presence on the nearby Super Star
            Destroyer Executor and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that
            prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of
            Imperial scout troopers that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on
            speeder bikes. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.
            <br><br>
            Upon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the droids went looking for her,
            only to be captured by a tribe of Ewoks. Using the Force to prove C-3PO's deific "magic", Skywalker
            convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after C-3PO's tale of their adventures, the whole group was
            accepted as a part of the village. However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the
            Force and landed on the moon, and knew that he had to confront Vader. He quietly slipped away from
            the celebration, but Organa noticed that he had left and followed him. He informed her of what he was
            planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last
            hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.
            <br><br>
            Organa was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to
            him that, somehow, she'd always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but
            Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.
            <br><br>
            Eventually encountering an Imperial patrol and willingly surrendering himself to Commander Igar,
            Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring
            to him as "Anakin Skywalker," but Vader harshly denounced his former name. Although he managed to
            make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him, Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner
            of the Emperor as he was escorted to his throne room onboard the Death Star.
        </p>

        <h4>The final duel</h4>
        <p>
            As he was brought before the Emperor, the Dark Lord of the Sith repeatedly told the young Jedi that he
            would fall to the dark side just as easily as Vader had, and let him know that he had purposely allowed
            the Alliance to discover the second Death Star's location in order to lure them into a trap and finish
            them off once and for all.
            <br><br>
            In order to temper Skywalker's negative emotions, Sidious forced him to watch as the Imperial Fleet
            engaged the Rebels. He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though
            Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the
            destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down
            the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous
            encounter on Bespin (where Vader was largely able to dominate the proceedings, throughout), this time
            the pair would fight as equals.
            <br><br>
            After successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before
            regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and
            attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight
            Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.
            <br><br>
            A cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to
            such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his
            apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he'd cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and
            in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker
            tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a
            Jedi like his father before him.
            <br><br>
            Infuriated that his plan to corrupt Luke had gone up in smoke, Sidious declared that, if Skywalker would
            not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of Force lightning against him. Unprepared
            for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail. During the Sith master
            assault on the Jedi Knight, Vader had gotten back to his feet and returned to his master's side, and
            Luke begged his father to save him.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, seeing his son in such terrible pain became too great for Vader to bear any longer, and in
            that moment, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was gone, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was reborn. In a
            snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the
            shaft to his death. In doing so, however, he turned Sidious's lethal Force lightning on himself,
            irreparably damaging his life-supporting armor.
        </p>

        <h4>Anakin redemption</h4>
        <p>
            Luke carried Anakin to Imperial shuttle ST 321, where his father asked him to remove his breathing
            mask. Though Luke was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Anakin told him
            that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his
            own eyes. Luke relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father's real face for the first and only
            time. Anakin then encouraged Luke to leave him and save himself. Though Luke was insistent on saving
            Anakin, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with
            his last words, told him to tell Leia that he'd been right about him before passing away. At the
            cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Anakin Skywalker had finally fulfilled his destiny as
            the Chosen One and had brought balance to the Force. Similarly, by helping his father to return to
            the light side of the Force by offering him unconditional love and refusing to fight, destroy, or let
            his anger eclipse the goodness in his heart, Luke Skywalker had achieved what Anakin and the whole Jedi
            Order failed to achieve upon being twisted by the Clone Wars: to forgive a monster and reveal a
            man.
            <br><br>
            Skywalker took his father's body on board the shuttle and escaped just before the Death Star's
            destruction, when he was almost intercepted by Green Squadron's Shara Bey, who proceeded to cover
            him from TIE interceptors after he identified himself.Back on Endor, Skywalker cremated his
            father's armor (his body had vanished) in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, and then joined his friends
            and sister in the celebration. It was during this moment of celebration that Skywalker saw the onlooking
            Force spirits of Kenobi, Yoda, and his father, looking at him in approval and with a sense of peace.
        </p>

        <h2>Personality and traits</h2>
        <p>
            In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for
            his present surroundings, and even a bit brash. Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and
            often had little regard for his own personal safety. According to Yoda, he had a "gaping need" for a
            connection to his father and to have a family. Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer
            with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained "about
            everything" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at
            lying, a trait that many people could infer. He once confided in Leia that he felt Tatooine had
            never felt like a home to him.
            <br><br>
            As his skills in the Force progressed, and especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker
            became more patient and seasoned. He was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years; however,
            he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone, and believing that
            Vader was redeemable. He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of
            endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the
            Clone Wars. Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite
            likely danger.
        </p>

        <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>
        <h3>Lightsaber abilities</h3>
        <p>
            Though he received little training, Luke Skywalker had a natural talent for lightsaber combat. Luke's
            initial training with the weapon of the Jedi came during a brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a
            training remote on the way to Alderaan, where he learned the initial position and the four defensive
            postures. Though his level proved inadequate during his first, but brief duel against Darth Vader on
            Cymoon 1, his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin, and culminated with him besting the
            Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like most Jedi, Skywalker was adept at redirecting blaster fire. During his mission to Rodia, he tried
            his hand at Jar'Kai for the first time with his and Huulik's lightsaber. Although he killed a ghest, he
            admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of "panicked reflexes and really good weapons." He
            received further training from the "Gamemaster," a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art
            of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt's MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory
            abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a brief time of training with Yoda, Skywalker revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin.
            Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding
            Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son
            and cut off his hand, proving his superiority. Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during
            the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the
            execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Skywalker showed his
            improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to
            fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Leia to the dark side, an
            enraged Skywalker unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.
        </p>

        <h3>Force powers</h3>
        <p>
            Like his father, Skywalker possessed a uniquely powerful connection to the Force, and became one of the
            most powerful Force wielders in galactic history. Indeed, Darth Sidious believed that Skywalker was
            strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith. Most of Luke's understanding of the Force came from his
            own research, exploration, and experience as he only had a few days Kenobi's mentorship before his
            demise, Yoda's one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi's sporadic guidance from
            beyond the Netherworld of the Force.
        </p>

        <p>
            After learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to sense through it, and took the habit
            of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware
            of his surroundings. In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father, and
            telepathically calling his sister. He was capable of seeing and hearing those who had become one with
            the Force. By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a
            shot that many thought was impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
            After obtaining Huulik's lightsaber and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on
            his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to
            learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.
            <br>
            By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though
            not without difficulty. Under Yoda's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to
            levitate several objects at once while meditating. Shortly after the revelation that Darth Vader was his
            father, Luke Skywalker lashed out with the Force, hurtling a squadron of Tie Fighters into each other.
            In another outburst, he accidentally cracked the window of a starship.
        </p>

        <p>
            Skywalker eventually learned other uses, such as mind control techniques. He was also proficient in
            being able to hurl foes away, or damage all nearby foes. Luke could use the Force to make great leaps.
        </p>

        <h3>Other abilities</h3>
        <p>
            Skywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying
            the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo). He also
            managed to destroy an Interdictor vessel on his own while piloting the Desert Jewel, although he
            acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the
            nick of time. He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease,
            outmaneuvering an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor that was trying to get a lock on him. In fact, Skywalker had a
            talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was a native speaker of Galactic Basic Standard, and although Skywalker could not understand
            Shyriiwook, he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca's moods by his tone and expression before the
            Battle of Yavin. After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak.
        </p>

        <p>
            Skywalker was adept in unarmed combat. He demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a
            few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground. <br>
            Shortly afterwards he found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shadaa.
            Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the
            rest.
