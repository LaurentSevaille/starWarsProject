                <b>Alderaan</b>, located in the Core Worlds, was a terrestrial planet covered with mountains. During the
                waning decades of the Galactic Republic, it was ruled by Queen Breha Organa and represented in the
                Galactic Senate by her husband, Senator Bail Prestor Organa. Alderaan was regarded for its natural
                beauty, its tranquility, and the sophistication of its arts and culture.
                <br><br>
                Following the rise of Sheev Palpatine's Galactic Empire, Alderaan played a pivotal role in the
                establishment of the <a href="./Article.html?page=Rebellion">Rebel Alliance</a>, a movement that sought to restore the Old Republic's values, and
                was one of it's earliest supporters. Because of its ties with the Alliance, the planet was destroyed
                when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin decided to test the superlaser of the <a href="./Article.html?page=Death Star">Death Star</a>, a moon-sized battle
                station developed by the <a href="./Article.html?page=Empire">Empire</a>, at full strength. Among the few survivors of that disaster was Princess

            From space, the planet of Alderaan, located in the star system of the same name, appeared as a blue-green
            orb enveloped in a white web of clouds. Its surface had vast bodies of water and was covered in
            snow-capped mountains, with patches of green grassy hills. Alderaan was known to the galaxy as "the
            planet of beauty." Alderaanians were very artistic and lived for this beauty, but the planet still hid
            treacherous cliffs and forgotten crevasses. Famous natural landmarks of Alderaan included the Cloudshape
            Falls, the Glarus Lagoons, and the Isatabith rain forest.
            <br><br>
            A variety of grapevines grew on Alderaan, which notably allowed to produce Toniray and emerald wine. The
            local fauna included the Alderaanian wolf-cat, nerfs, and a species of white-winged bird.
            <br><br>
            The cities on Alderaan were carefully designed to respect the natural beauty of their environment. For
            example, the palace of the royal family, which as been the work of over a millennium, and the city
            around it blended into the local snow-capped peaks. Alderaanian architecture made use of white synthstone,
            which inspired the architecture of certain mining economies of the Outer Rim Territories, like the floating
            colony of Cloud City, and the planets Lothal and Garel.
            <br><br>
            Despite the lyrics of the traditional Alderaanian lullaby "Mirrorbright" referencing a moon, the planet
            never possessed any natural satellites.

                <figcaption>Alderaan's Royal Palace.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            The peaceful world of Alderaan was among the oldest members of the Galactic Republic, the democratic
            union that governed most of the galaxy, and was among the worlds that originally founded it.
            <br><br>
            Upon the formation of its monarchy it was established that the heir apparent to Alderaan must complete a
            Challenge of the Heart, Challenge of the Mind and Challenge of the Body which would be announced on
            their Day of Demand and upon completion they would be officially invested as heir. In ancient times,
            Alderaanian heirs who partook in their Day of Demand had to fight their way into the palace throne
            room.
            <br><br>
            During the High Republic Era, Alderaan was a prosperous world and, as a signatory of the Republic
            Defense Coalition treaties, was required to lend starships and personnel to be commanded by Republic
            military officers during times of crisis. These ships and personnel would then be returned to Alderaan
            after the crisis ended. Alderaan was called upon to fulfill this obligation in c. 232 BBY, to aid
            the Republic in fighting the Nihil, a group of marauders who caused the Great Hyperspace Disaster.
            <br><br>
            At some point between 40 BBY and 28 BBY, the heir apparent of Alderaan, sixteen year old Princess Breha
            Organa, took part in her Day of Demand where she announced her challenges of the heart, mind and body.
            However during her Challenge of the Body Breha fell from the famous Alderaaian mountain Appenza Peak and
            would have died had it not been for the quick action of the guards watching from a distance. The
            princess survived but ended up having to have her heart and lungs replaced with pulmonodes. After her
            fall Breha was officially invested as crown princess and heir to the throne of Alderaan. Years later the
            people would still speak of Breha's accident.
            <br><br>
            Breha Organa eventually succeeded her mother as queen of Alderaan.
            <br><br>
            By the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Alderaan had not seen conflict in generations. The planet was
            represented in the Galactic Senate by Senator Bail Antilles. That year, the then-Supreme Chancellor of
            the Republic, Finis Valorum, was ousted from office, and Antilles was nominated for the position in the
            resulting election. However, the Alderaanian senator was defeated by Senator Sheev Palpatine, who
            represented the sovereign system of Naboo.
            <br><br>
            In 28 BBY, former queen of Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala and her entourage were invited to
            Alderaan by Queen Breha and stayed at the royal palace for a week before returning home to Naboo.

            <h3 id="a2l2">The Clone Wars</h3>
            <p>
                Ten years later, Alderaan was represented in the Senate by Viceroy Bail Prestor Organa, the prince
                consort of the planet's ruler, Queen Breha Organa. At that time, the Republic was facing a
                secessionist crisis due to the existence of the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Count Dooku,
                pushing the galaxy to the brink of war. Through Organa, Alderaan was a member of Chancellor Palpatine's
                Loyalist Committee, which concerned itself with the stability of the Republic during the Separatist
                crisis and would later strive to limit Palpatine's increasing executive authority. That year, an army of
                clones was discovered on the planet Kamino, which would be appropriated by the Senate in order to combat
                the Separatists. To save the Republic from the impending threat, the Supreme Chancellor was granted
                emergency powers, a decision that was contrary to the pacifist values of Alderaan and its representative
                and which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. During the Clone Wars Viceroy Bail
                Organa became Alderaan's military leader.

                <figcaption>Alderaan Refugee Conference during the Clone Wars.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br><br>
            At some point during the Clone Wars, Alderaan hosted a conference concerned with aiding war refugees.
            Padmé Amidala, then senator of Naboo, was nearly assassinated during the conference when the Hutt crime
            lord Ziro, whom Amidala had sent to prison, hired the bounty hunter Aurra Sing to take revenge. The
            plot, however, was thwarted by the Jedi apprentice Ahsoka Tano. Many refugees from all over the
            Republic came to stay on Alderaan during the war to find their way again or to stay.
            <br><br>
            Queen Breha and Viceroy Bail would send aid to worlds that had been ravaged by the Separatists, sending
            not just money and supplies but also doctors, teachers, architects, builders, medics, and droids.
            <br><br>
            Around the time of the Battle of Kadavo, two Alderaanian tourists visiting Tatooine died in a
            speeder-bike accident. The Zygerrian News implied that the two had gotten intoxicated in the cantina of
            Mos Eisley, which caused the accident.
            <br><br>
            The Clone Wars saw a change in Alderaan. Although was still a peaceful planet with no large weaponry,
            the royal fleet had "more teeth," their officers had seen more hardship, they manufactured more
            practical items in larger quantities, and the planet had begun to quietly fill up due to the number of
            refugees.
            <br><br>
            Following the end of the Clone Wars, Viceroy Bail and Queen Breha adopted Leia Amidala Skywalker, the
            daughter of the now deceased Padmé Amidala and former Jedi Knight turned Sith Lord Anakin Skywalker,
            renaming her to Leia Organa and making her princess of Alderaan. Leia's adoption was announced on her
            Name Day three or four days after her birth and was publicly celebrated on Alderaan.

            In 3 BBY, Leia Organa took part in her Day of Demand and after completing her three challenges became
            invested as crown princess and the future queen of Alderaan.
            <br><br>
            With the Clone Wars coming to an end, Chancellor Palpatine had abolished the Republic, establishing the
            Galactic Empire in its stead. However, a small number of systems rebelled against this new regime,
            and the Alliance to Restore the Republic was ultimately formed by Bail Organa and his former colleague
            in the Galactic Senate, Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila. During this time, Alderaan became the
            Alliance's main source of munitions. The planet's crown princess and representative in the Imperial
            Senate, Princess Leia Organa, began using her diplomatic immunity as an Imperial senator to carry out
            Rebel missions in restricted Imperial systems.
            <br><br>
            During the Galactic Civil War, Alderaan was listed as an Alliance safe world. It was included in a map
            of the galaxy with a legend listing the various Alliance safe worlds, starfighter hubs at level five or
            higher, rebel operations sectors and regional headquarters, and shadow planets with deep space caches.
            The map would later be incorporated into The Rebel Files.
            <br><br>
            About three years before the Battle of Yavin, Senator Bail Organa dispatched three Sphyrna-class
            Hammerhead corvettes to the Phoenix Cell, which has sustained losses while fleeing Garel. Since Alderaan
            could not be seen directly supporting the rebels, Senator Organa arranged for his adopted daughter Leia
            to deliver the vessels to Lothal. The Alderaanians risked losing their seat in the Imperial Senate among
            other Imperial sanctions. Senator Organa had arranged for the crew of the Ghost to "steal" the ships
            from an Imperial depot on Lothal so that Alderaan could not be blamed for the "theft." With the help of
            the crew of the Ghost and the former Governor Ryder Azadi, Leia managed to deliver the three Hammerhead
            corvettes to the Phoenix rebels following a skirmish at the Imperial depot.
            </p>

            <h3 id="a2l4">Destruction</h3>
            <p>
                In 0 BBY, shortly before the Battle of Scarif, and three weeks prior to the equinox festivities, Senator
                Bail Organa headed towards Alderaan to tell their people that there would "be no peace," after the
                plans for the Death Star, a planet-killing Imperial superlaser, were discovered. The plans were later
                stolen from the data vault on Scarif, and transferred aboard the Tantive IV. Princess Leia of Alderaan,
                Bail's adopted daughter and thus member of the Elder Houses was captured by the Imperial Navy while
                smuggling the plans to the Alliance base. Organa was taken prisoner by Vader, the Emperor's
                second-in-command, and brought before the Death Star's commanding officer, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin.
                <br><br>

                <figcaption>The Death Star fires on Alderaan.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Under threat of destroying her planet, Leia gave a fake location of the rebel base to Tarkin, only for
            Tarkin to nevertheless destroy Alderaan—noting that Dantooine was too remote for an "effective
            demonstration"—to punish the world for supporting the Rebellion, hoping the annihilation of the
            entire world would make the rest of the galaxy fear Imperial retribution for supporting the Rebels. The
            Imperials forced the princess to witness the obliteration of her home planet. The planet's destruction
            left only an asteroid field behind, which was blockaded by the Empire.
            <br><br>
            On Coruscant, the Empire's planetary capital, the numerous Alderaanian residents of Level 3204 began to
            hold vigils for those who had perished in what they called "the Disaster." However, as more information
            became available about the Empire's role in the destruction of Alderaan, the vigils soon turned into
            riots, which were quickly repressed by brute force. The Empire defended the destruction of the
            planet to its military, claiming that its population had chosen its destruction by supporting
            anarchy. A short time after Alderaan's destruction, the Death Star was destroyed in the Battle of
            Yavin, taking Tarkin and many other high ranking Imperials with it.
            <br><br>
            Under the orders of Vader, the Imperial Military was to "complete" the destruction of Alderaan by
            hunting any remaining Alderaanians. Almost immediately after the Death Star's destruction, Leia
            Organa would embark on a mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan from Imperial reprisals. Also
            following the Battle of Yavin, Vader took the remains of Alderaan to serve as reminders to worlds that
            attempted to resist the Emperor; following an assassination attempt on himself at Shu-Torun, Vader then
            gave Trios, the new Queen of that planet, one of these reminders.

                Alderaan hosted a population of humans, known as Alderaanians, who were known for their philosophy of
                paciﬁsm. Even in time of galactic conflicts, the Alderaanians shunned weapons. They were not, however,
                bereft of spirit, as many of them chose to join the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Their society
                was ruled by the House of Organa, in conjunction with an individual bearing the titles of Viceroy
                and First Chairman. The female child of the royal couple was referred to as a princess. For
                diplomatic missions, the Royal Family used streamlined cruisers.

                According to Nash Windrider, on Alderaan, its people were encouraged to learn and grow. All education
                was free, and people would volunteer to teach various skills or crafts just for fun. Queen Breha
                herself served as the minister of education, and personally mentored a select number of young
                Alderaanians, including Evaan Verlaine, teaching them about the culture and heritage of their
                homeworld.

                Alderaan also had a number of traditions involving braids such as who wore them, when and why that
                varied from continent to continent and age to age. The Alderaaian monarch was expected to wear
                braids.
                <br><br>
                Every child of Alderaan owned a keepsake chest whose designs would be carved by the child's parents and
                grandparents though the child themselves choose what went inside. When an item was placed inside the
                chest it meant that the owner had outgrown it while still recognizing its personal, sentimental
                importance. In adulthood, an Alderaanian could then open their chest, look back, and see how they had
                chosen to tell their own story. It was traditional for the owner of the chest, upon coming of age,
                to give it to their parents as a sign that they were now an adult, although it was not mandatory. Many
                heirs of Alderaan would give up their keepsake chest before their investiture as crown prince or
                princess though the ritual didn't demand it.
