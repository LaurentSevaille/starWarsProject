            <p>
                <b> Darth Vader</b>, was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic 
                Republic and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. 
                Also known as "Ani" during his childhood, and earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" 
                from his accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, 
                was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, pledging his allegiance to the Sith 
                Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic Era. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A vergence in the Force, Skywalker was born on the desert planet of Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories 
                in 41 BBY. He was the son of Shmi Skywalker, a slave who conceived a child without a father. His blood 
                contained over twenty-thousand midi-chlorians, surpassing that of Grand Master Yoda and all other Jedi in 
                the galaxy. Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi Master who discovered Skywalker during the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, 
                theorized that Skywalker was conceived by the midi-chlorians. Following the Battle of Naboo, the Jedi High 
                Council admitted Skywalker into the Order as the Padawan of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi despite feeling that 
                he was too old and emotional to adhere to the Jedi Code. During the early days of the Clone Wars, Skywalker 
                served as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, commanding the clone troopers of the elite 501st 
                Legion against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He also oversaw the Jedi training of his own apprentice, 
                Ahsoka Tano, after receiving his knighthood. Although Jedi doctrine prohibited personal relationships, 
                Skywalker had a secret wife, Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After Skywalker's faith in the Jedi High Council was shaken when Tano left the Jedi Order in 19 BBY, 
                Skywalker learned that Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the elusive Dark Lord of 
                the Sith who orchestrated the war in order to take over the galaxy. Manipulated into believing that the 
                Jedi had failed him and coupled with his fear of losing Amidala in childbirth, Skywalker betrayed and turned 
                against the Jedi Order, believing Sidious had the knowledge to cheat death. Consumed by the persona of Darth 
                Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marched his legion on the Jedi Temple of Coruscant where they executed its 
                inhabitants, including Jedi younglings, as part of Order 66 and the Great Jedi Purge. Vader was then sent 
                to Mustafar to exterminate the Separatist Council at the behest of his Sith Master, who became 
                the self-proclaimed Galactic Emperor. Vader subsequently sustained severe injuries in his duel with Kenobi, 
                and was rebuilt as an armored cyborg while his wife died of a broken heart, though not before giving birth 
                to the twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa who were hidden from their father and the Emperor as the 
                Galactic Empire rose to power. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Being the Emperor's Fist and acting as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Military despite not holding a 
                military rank, Vader enforced the rule of the New Order as the Emperor's Sith apprentice throughout most 
                of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of killing Kenobi in their third rematch and the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, 
                he discovered the existence of his son and was determined to turn Luke to the dark side. Luke sought to become 
                a Jedi, like his father before him, and believed that Vader had the potential to turn back to the light side of 
                the Force. Vader was defeated by Luke during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, but the young Jedi refused to strike 
                down his father in anger, causing the Emperor to torture Luke with Force lightning. The pain inflicted on his 
                son awakened the part of Vader that was still Anakin, resulting in a redeemed Skywalker killing Sidious at the 
                cost of his own life. Having destroyed the Sith and fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One, Skywalker made 
                peace with his son and became one with the Force.

            <h3 id="l1">Early life</h3>
            <p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./IMG/as_clones-war.jpg" alt="baby ani" class="content_img" title="Anakin as a baby">
                <figcaption>Quite the sexy lad when he was young,<br>wasn't he ?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Believed to have been conceived by the midi-chlorians, Anakin Skywalker was born to the slave Shmi Skywalker.
            Although Skywalker was listed as born on the desert planet of Tatooine, a holographic log stated that Shmi 
            and he moved to the planet when Skywalker was at a very young age. Regardless, Tatooine was Skywalker's homeworld.
            Skywalker and his mother were originally owned by Gardulla the Hutt until she lost them to the Toydarian Watto 
            in a podracing bet when Skywalker was around age 3. Affectionately nicknamed "Ani," he worked in his master's 
            shop, located in Mos Espa.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, at the age of 9, Watto shouted for him to come inside the junk shop, to find a tall man, 
                a young woman, a Gungan, and an astromech droid, conversing with Watto. Skywalker had first seen 
                the young woman, Padmé Naberrie, when he looked up from his work, mistaking her for an angel, a 
                species he had overheard spacers talk about, from the moons of Iego. Unknown to Skywalker, Naberrie was in 
                fact Padmé Amidala, the Monarch of Naboo, who had switched places with one of her Royal Handmaidens, 
                to visit Tatooine.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Watto's instructions, Skywalker manned the shop while Watto took the man, Qui-Gon Jinn, into the junkyard. 
                Skywalker was fascinated by the beauty of Padmé, so much that he asked her if she was an angel. 
                Shortly after Watto and Jinn returned to the shop, Jinn informed his companions that they were leaving.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately for Skywalker, Watto allowed him to leave after he cleaned up the mess that Jar Jar Binks had made. 
                As he headed home, Skywalker came across Binks, who was being attacked by Sebulba after the clumsy 
                Gungan had disrupted the racer's meal. Breaking up the fight, Skywalker greeted Naberrie and the rest of her 
                group when they arrived to see what was happening, and he convinced the group to follow him to Jira's fruit 
                stand nearby. As he gave one of the pallies to Jinn, the boy was astonished to see a lightsaber on the man's 
                waist when his poncho opened. When Jira warned the group that a sandstorm was coming, Skywalker insisted that 
                the unprepared group come with him to his home.
            </p>


            <p>
                There, he proposed the group to win a race and use the money earned with a bet on him winning the pod race. 
                The group and his mother reluctantly accepted, aggreeing that it was the only way and Anakin won the race with the pod he built himself for years.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the crisis on Naboo ended and his potential master died while resolving it, the boy was to be trained under
                Obi-Wan Kenobi, the former apprentice of the late Qui-Gon Jinn.
                Obi-Wan promised his master he would train the boy even without the permission of the council, which reluctantly gave their permission.
            </p>

            <p>
                Eventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father's natural piloting
                skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine. At one point in his boyhood, Skywalker was
                climbing in a canyon, but, when he grabbed the top, the rock broke off. Skywalker fell into a cave,
                where he was seen by a group of womp rats and a krayt dragon, although he managed to escape the
                creatures. Years later, C-3PO referenced this story to several visitors. When Skywalker was 12 years
                old in 7 BBY, he and his friend, Windy went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and
                wandered away from the moisture farms riding a dewback. The two encountered a sandstorm during their
                time outside and both lost consciousness. A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they
                were saved by Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to the Lars family. Skywalker
                asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father.
                Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.
        
            </p>

            <h3 id="l2">Before the War</h3>

            <p>
                The duo was usually sent on the same mission, but after an attempt on former Queen Amidala in 22 BBY, 
                the Council sent the Master and Padawan on separate missions —Skywalker, on his first solo mission, 
                would protect Amidala on Naboo, whereas Kenobi continued an investigation into Amidala's aggressors that took 
                him to Kamino. Joined by R2-D2, Skywalker and Amidala departed for Naboo aboard the Jendirian Valley, a refugee 
                ship leaving from the western spaceport. On Naboo, the two visited Amidala's family home, and Skywalker noticed 
                how much she loved the flower garden maintained by her father, Ruwee Naberrie.
            </p>

            <p>
                While on Naboo, as he experienced inner conflict between his strong desires for her and his duties as a Jedi, 
                Skywalker revealed to Amidala his love for her, but she refused since Skywalker was not supposed to form 
                attachments as a Jedi, even though she felt the same for him. Skywalker was also troubled by dreams of his 
                mother suffering, which prompted him to return to Tatooine and rescue her, to which Amidala agreed to accompany 
                him. On Tatooine, the two located Watto, who revealed that he had sold Shmi to a moisture farmer named Cliegg 
                Lars. The couple then visited the Lars farm only to discover that Shmi had been abducted by Tusken Raiders about 
                a month before their arrival, and was feared to be dead. Determined to save her at all costs, Skywalker took 
                the swoop bike of his stepbrother, Owen Lars, and searched for his mother.
            </p>

            <p>

                    <img src="./IMG/shmi_death.png" alt="death shmi" class="content_img" title="Death of Shmi Skywalker">
                    <figcaption>Anakin holding his mother<br>trying to fulfill his promise before her death</figcaption>
                </figure>
                Though he managed to find her in a Tusken camp, she had her wrists tied up to a stick, and she had 
                a cut on the side of her face and then she died in his arms moments later. Consumed with grief and 
                rage, Skywalker slaughtered the entire village of Tusken Raiders—men, women, and children. 
                Only then did Skywalker bring his mother's body back to the homestead, where her funeral was held, 
                and when he claimed he would become so powerful in the Force he could stop the people he loved from 
                dying. The event left him full of pain and guilt, for failing her and failing as a Jedi, as well 
                as haunted by the prospect of letting go of the people he loved.
            </p>

                It was then that Skywalker received a message from Kenobi telling him of Separatist presence on Geonosis, 
                which they retransmitted to Coruscant so that the Jedi Council could see it for themselves. Upon learning he 
                had been captured, Skywalker and Amidala departed for the planet, where they entered one of the factories 
                (where his lightsaber was destroyed) but were subsequently captured and placed with Kenobi into the Petranaki 
                Arena to be executed by beasts. However, the trio managed to avoid the creatures (in Skywalker's case, a reek), 
                only to be surrounded by droidekas on Count Dooku's orders.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, a Jedi assault team, led by Mace Windu, arrived to rescue them. Nevertheless, they fought a losing battle against 
                an overwhelming amount of battle droids, including droidekas, B1-series battle droids and B2-series 
                super battle droids, until Master Yoda arrived with the newly established Grand Army of the Republic and safely 
                boarded the survivors of the arena onto LAAT/i gunships. As the battle raged between the clone troopers and the 
                Separatist Droid Army, they caught sight of Dooku. When Amidala and a clone trooper were knocked from the troop 
                bay by a cannon blast, Skywalker argued with Kenobi about going after her. After he proclaimed he did not care 
                if he would be expelled from the Jedi Order if it meant saving her, Skywalker only agreed to continue when 
                Kenobi reminded him Amidala would continued on her duties if she had been in a similar crisis. Skywalker then 
                looked back at where she had fallen as they continued to race after Dooku.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kenobi and Skywalker pursued the Count to a secret hangar, where they engaged him in a duel. 
                Both were defeated, and though Kenobi suffered minor wounds, Skywalker lost his right forearm. 
                It was then that Yoda arrived and fought Dooku until the Sith Lord made his escape on his solar sailer. 
                The battle marked the start of the pan-galactic Clone Wars, and Skywalker received a cybernetic replacement 
                for his lost arm.

                While Kenobi returned to Coruscant, Skywalker accompanied Amidala to Naboo, where they were secretly married, 
                their sole attendants being their faithful droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. As he still needed to recover from the 
                Battle of Geonosis, Skywalker was able to remain on Naboo for several days, enjoying his honeymoon and 
                time after it with Amidala.

            <h3 id="l3">The War and Fall</h3>
         
            <p>
                Skywalker became the general of the 501st, a Legion of clone troopers in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic
                agains the Separatist forces during the Clone Wars. Their, he accumulated the acts of courage, and also bravado, much to his 
                former master's dismay, as Anakin became a Jedi Knight during the war. He kept his relation with his wife
                Padmé, still meeting her in secret whenever he could.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, because of the scheming and plotting of Sheev Palpatine, the secret Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, 
                the now Grand Chancellor of the Republic against the Separatist forces led by his secret apprentice Count Dooku,
                Anaking turned against his former allies and friends.
            </p>

            <p>

                    <img src="./IMG/501.png" alt="501st" class="content_img" title="Vader leading the 501st "  style="width: 150px">

                </figure>
                Sidious made him kill his own apprentice while Obi-Wan was unconscious, preventing him to stop Anakin
                if he had any doubts about killing a then defensless enemy. Later, when a group of Jedi went to confront Palpatine 
                about his true identity, he sided with Sidious and killed the remaining Jedi Windu and destroyed any chance to
                stop the Dark Lord before he could set in motion the last phase of his plan to take unlimited power of the galaxy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Sidious gave his new apprentice his new name of Darth Vader while still mourning for the decision he made.
                In order to make Vader pledge his allegiance to him, Sidious reminded him he needed the power of the Dark Side 
                in order to save his wife, who he saw in a vision die during childbirth. He then ordered his new 
                apprentice to invade the Jedi temple and kill all the Jedi residing there, as part of Order 66, an 
                order the clones were manufactured to fulfill no matter what, depriving the whole army of free will.
            </p>

            <p>
                As to conclude the war, Sidious then sent Vader to the planet Mustafar where the remaining leaders of the Separatist
                forces hid. The leaders thought he was sent to declare the war ended, but Vader slaughtered them all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately for Vader, after hearing from Obi-Wan about Anakin's betrayal, Padmé came to Mustafar to
                see if all of this were true. Unknown to her, Anakin's former master hid in her ship, leading him to 
                his former apprentice. Vader took it as a betrayal from her and choked her to death.
            </p>

                </figure>
                Former master and apprentice then fought against one another while Yoda was battling Sidious in the Senate.
                Yoda lost his duel, and Vader his, Obi-wan leaving him wounded and severely burnt to die on Mustafar.
                But through his anger and Sidious intervention, he maintained his life as now a being part man, part machine
                without any sign of Anakin's life remaining inside him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just as his operation in order to maintain his life ended, Vader asked where his wife was, not seeing and
                feeling her presence. Sidious declared to him that in his anger he killed her. Vader left the operation 
                table in shock and anger and yelled all his despair out while observed by a smiling new 
                self-appointed Emperor of the New Galactic Empire Palpatine. Unbeknownst to the both of them, Padmé gave
                birth to twins, Luke and Leia, in her dying breath, still believing there was good in Anakin remaining.

            <h3 id="l4">Fist of the Emperor</h3>

                <h4 id="l4l1">Before the Battle of Yavin</h4>

                <p>
                    As Anakin became Vader, he became the "Emperor's Fist", completely under the service of the Emperor's will.
                    He was tasked to hunt the remaining Jedi throughout the whole galaxy with the Inquisitors, a special force
                    created for the occasion and to destroy any spark of rebellion against the Empire and its Emperor.
                    Around 0 BBY, he was sent to recover the stolen plans of the Death Star, a battle station capable of destroying
                    a whole planet in a single shot from space, the latest weapon created for the Emperor to spread fear across the galaxy.
                    The plans were stolen by a group of Rebels who escaped an Imperial research base containing the plans after an assault on the planet Scarif.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite their daring escape, the Rebels aboard the Tantive IV did not get far. After failing to capture the plans 
                    aboard the Profundity, Vader had immediately re-boarded the Devastator and pursued the Rebel corvette. The 
                    Devastator intercepted the Tantive IV in orbit above Tatooine, and quickly disabled and captured it. Vader and his 
                    troops boarded the ship, killing many Rebel troopers and gaining complete control of the blockade runner. Vader 
                    interrogated its captain, Raymus Antilles, before killing him for not revealing the location of the plans. Vader's 
                    troops captured the princess, but not before she placed the plans inside R2-D2 and sent him in an escape pod to the 
                    planet's surface. Although the Princess tried to use her diplomatic immunity as a member of the Imperial Senate, 
                    Vader had her arrested as a rebel and a traitor.
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As she was escorted to the Devastator,Vader was informed that an escape pod had been jettisoned during 
                    the fighting but that no life forms were aboard. Believing that the Princess had hidden the plans there, 
                    Vader sent a battalion to Tatooine to recover the plans while he took the Princess to the Death Star for 
                    interrogation.In hyperspace, Vader would catch Organa when she had escaped her guards and made her way 
                    to one of the Devastator's shuttles, and announced that the Emperor was disbanding the Senate as they spoke, 
                    leaving her defenseless. Vader then had her follow him to the ship's bridge shortly before arriving at the 
                    Death Star, where he had her sent to her cell in Detention Block AA-23.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, Vader accompanied Tarkin to attend a meeting with the Joint Chiefs, including General 
                    Cassio Tagge and Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, who mocked Vader's reliance on an "ancient religion," 
                    only to have Vader Force-choke him. Before he could kill him, Tarkin intervened and instructed 
                    Vader to find the location of the Rebel base from Organa. Subsequently, Vader went to torture 
                    her with a mind probe-equipped interrogator droid, but as she resisted, he and Tarkin turned 
                    to coercion—by bringing the Death Star to the Alderaan system, they threatened to destroy her 
                    homeworld if she refused to disclose the location of the Rebel base. Eventually, she told him that the 
                    Rebels were on Dantooine, yet Tarkin ordered Alderaan to be destroyed anyway, to make an effective 
                    demonstration of the Death Star's power. Vader restrained the Princess as the Death Star's superlaser 
                    destroyed her planet. Vader then took Organa back to her cell to await her execution.

                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the scout ships sent to Dantooine found the base abandoned, Tarkin ordered Vader to kill her immediately, 
                    but the Millennium Falcon was captured in the ruins of Alderaan by the Death Star's tractor beam. Identified as 
                    a suspicious ship from Mos Eisley, Vader concluded that they were trying to return the stolen plans to the 
                    Princess and went to inspect the freighter himself. Told that the crew had apparently abandoned ship after 
                    take-off, Vader gave orders for the ship to be scanned to be sure. At the same time, Vader sensed the presence 
                    of his old master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. When news reached him that the Princess had been released from her cell, 
                    Vader decided to confront Kenobi alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vader found Kenobi after he had deactivated a tractor beam terminal to allow the Falcon escape the battle station, 
                    and the two engaged in one final duel. During the fight, Vader noted that Kenobi's age had made him weak. However, 
                    Kenobi told his former apprentice that he would not win because he would become more powerful than Vader could ever 
                    imagine, even if he managed to kill him. As they fought, the two reached Bay 327 just as Kenobi's companions and 
                    the Princess reunited to board the Falcon, only for Kenobi to see his latest apprentice, Luke Skywalker, Vader's son.

                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As his former master gave him a mysteriously knowing smile, Vader struck him down when Kenobi raised his blade 
                    in surrender. Much to Vader's surprise, Kenobi's body disappeared, for his spirit had become one with the Force, 
                    and Vader tried to find remains in his robes but found none. As he did so, General Moradmin Bast asked who he was, 
                    and Vader answered "An old man who thought he could help gifted children. He was mistaken." Vader then tried to 
                    stop the Rebels from escaping but was prevented from doing so by the closing of the hangar doors by Luke's shot. 
                    After the Falcon's escape, Vader met with Tarkin and confirmed that a homing beacon had been placed upon the ship 
                    and that they could follow the ship to the Rebel base.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kenobi's warning to Vader came true; his consciousness survived his death, and he became a Force spirit. 
                    Meanwhile, still remaining hidden on Dagobah, Yoda felt Kenobi and Vader's duel through the Force, especially 
                    noticing, for the first time, the loneliness in the man who had once been Anakin Skywalker. Yoda noticed that 
                    Vader's loneliness only grew after he struck down his former mentor, which nearly made Yoda pity the former Jedi 
                    and wish he could counsel him. As he continued his journey, Yoda reflected on his past, blaming himself for not 
                    noticing Skywalker's path to the dark side.
                </p>


                <h4 id="l4l2">The Battle of Yavin</h4>

                <p>
                    Vader's plan worked and the Death Star followed the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base on Yavin 4. 
                    As the Death Star prepared to destroy the moon, Rebel X-wings and Y-wings starfighters attacked 
                    the Death Star, having identified a weakness: a thermal exhaust port which led to the reactor systems; 
                    a direct hit on the port would cause a chain reaction and the destruction of the station. Although Tarkin 
                    remained convinced in the station's invulnerability, Vader was informed by Lieutenant Tanbris that the thirty 
                    attacking Rebel starfighters were small enough to avoid the turbolaser defenses. As such, Vader ordered fighters 
                    to launch. When Gold Squadron broke off from the main group and begun a trench run towards the exhaust port, 
                    Vader boarded his TIE Advanced and, flanked by two TIE fighters, managed to terminate three of the last four 
                    Gold Squadron pilots. He continued to destroy most ships of Red Squadron, killing Red Leader Garven Dreis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the last members of Red Squadron engaged in a trench run while the Death Star was preparing the destroy 
                    the moon, Vader damaged Wedge Antilles's X-wing, forcing him to break off formation, and killed Biggs Darklighter, 
                    leaving only the leader of the group, Luke. Vader quickly realized that the Force was powerful in the young pilot, 
                    but nevertheless proceeded to get him into range. When he finally succeeded, he was just about to destroy the 
                    young pilot when the newly arrived Millennium Falcon intervened and destroyed one of Vader's escorts. Before the 
                    Falcon could destroy Vader, his other escort accidentally bumped into Vader's craft, destroying the other escort 
                    and causing Vader's craft to veer off course and send him plunging into space. This prevented him from stopping 
                    the Death Star's destruction, which killed Tarkin and was a major defeat for the Empire.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shortly after the battle, Vader sent a distress signal to the Devastator to send a ship to pick him up and bring 
                    him back from the Yavin system to the Star Destroyer. Sometime later, he would fly just beyond the ever-expanding 
                    debris field that once was the Death Star, when Imperial pilots Ciena Ree and Berisse Sai arrived in a Gozanti-class 
                    cruiser. Docking his TIE Advanced x1 with the freighter, Vader passed through the airlock door and met Ree. 
                    Then, he ordered Ree and Sai to remain in the hold for the remainder of the voyage while he took command of 
                    the freighter until they returned to the Devastator. Then, as if he were talking to Kenobi, Vader vowed to find the boy's identity and to turn 
                    him to the dark side, so that the boy became his weapon, and not Kenobi's. Later Vader learned from a bounty hunter the 
                    name of the the boy who destroyed the Death Star, "Skywalker", making him realize Luke is the son he thought he lost when his wife died.

            <h3 id="l5">The Empire's revenge</h3>
                <h4 id="l5l1">The battle of Hoth</h4>
                
                <p>
                    By the time three years had passed after the Battle of Yavin, Vader was still in command of the Executor, 
                    under the admiralty of Ozzel, as well as its accompanying fleet, Death Squadron. At Vader's request, 
                    Lieutenant Commander Ciena Ree was transferred from the Devastator to the Executor; Ree believed, however, 
                    that Vader's request had been more threat than reward, as she remained forever vulnerable to him for seeing 
                    him during Yavin's immediate aftermath. Obsessed with finding Luke, Vader dispatched thousands of Viper 
                    probe droids as Project Swarm, with the droids being sent into the far reaches of space in order to 
                    find his son.
                </p>

                    The Executor eventually received a fragmented report from probe droid XJ9-CS14, which had been sent to the Hoth 
                    system. Although Admiral Ozzel dismissed the news as a false lead, both Vader and Captain Firmus Piett agreed 
                    that they had found the Rebel base. Vader then gave orders for the fleet to depart for the system. As the fleet 
                    came out of hyperspace near Hoth, Vader was informed by General Veers that orbital bombardment was impossible 
                    as an energy shield defended Echo Base. Vader guessed from this information that the Alliance knew of their 
                    presence because Ozzel had made the fleet exit hyperspace too close to the system. After ordering Veers to 
                    prepare his troops for a ground assault, Vader executed Ozzel for his incompetence and promoted Captain Piett 
                    to replace him as Admiral, and had him deploy the fleet so that no Rebel ship escaped the system.

                    As the Imperial ground forces led by Veers engaged the Alliance,Vader led an assault troop into the Rebel 
                    base and broke their lines, but they found it mostly deserted, for General Carlist Rieekan had ordered its 
                    evacuation pre-emptively.[14] Vader entered the base and soon ran into a group of Rebels carrying their unconscious 
                    captain towards a hangar. They open fire, and Vader deflected their shots before leaping and cutting down a Rebel 
                    trooper named Beak. Another trooper, named Roja, threw a grenade at Vader, who used the Force to deflect it. It 
                    knocked out their sergeant, Hazram Namir, and Roja was killed soon after. The last Rebel was the former Imperial 
                    governor of Haidoral Prime, Everi Chalis. She had been pursued by Imperial forces in the weeks following her 
                    defection and assumed Vader was there for her. Vader only asked her where Luke was, and when a trooper told him 
                    that they had located the Millennium Falcon, he pushed her aside and marched in the direction of his target. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Only the Millennium Falcon remained at the base's hangar, but the light freighter was able to escape before Vader 
                    could capture it. With the Alliance's forces on Hoth in complete retreat and the various transports scattered 
                    throughout the galaxy, Vader and his troops had secured a great victory for the Empire. Rather than pursuing 
                    the Rebel transports which had gotten away, Vader redirected his Death Squadron's efforts to capturing the 
                    Millennium Falcon, which had evaded Imperial forces in the Hoth asteroid belt due to its faulty hyperdrive. 
                    Despite Piett's reservations, Vader ordered the fleet to pursue the ship into the asteroid field, and told 
                    the Executor's crew that he wanted the freighter towed aboard and its passengers taken alive. Even though 
                    the asteroids heavily damaged the Star Destroyers, Vader instructed every ship to sweep the field until the Falcon 
                    was found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Piett then informed him that the Emperor commanded him to make contact, and Vader had the Executor move out of 
                    the field to have a clear transmission. Vader contacted his master; the Emperor told him that he had sensed a 
                    new threat in the Force: Luke Skywalker, who he feared could destroy them if he ever became a Jedi, and that he 
                    was Anakin's son. Feigning shock at the Emperor's revelation, Vader believed Luke could be turned to the dark side 
                    and prove a powerful ally. Although the Emperor was doubtful, Vader assured him that Luke would join them or die.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Determined to find his son before the Emperor, Vader summoned several bounty hunters—4-LOM, Bossk, Zuckuss, 
                    Dengar, IG-88, and Boba Fett—to the Executor, and promised a substantial reward for the one who found the Falcon's 
                    crew alive. As he was briefing the hunters, Piett informed Vader that the Avenger was tracking the Falcon. Vader 
                    requested an update from the ship's commander, Captain Lorth Needa, who reported that he had lost the Falcon and 
                    assumed full responsibility for this. Vader accepted his apology with a fatal Force choke, and then ordered Piett 
                    to alert all commands of the Falcon's disappearance.

                <h4 id="l5l2">Revealing the truth on Cloud City</h4>
                
                <p>
                    As the Falcon traveled through realspace to try and repair its hyperdrive on Bespin, Fett tracked and predicted 
                    Solo's movements, but also contacted Vader, whose Executor reached Bespin before the freighter.
                    Along with a strike team comprising only a few individuals, Vader left the Executor for Cloud City, leaving its 
                    crew to do nothing but wait hidden. At the city, Vader contacted its Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian, who 
                    happened to be Solo's friend, to make a deal. Calrissian, whose tibanna mining operation was keen to evade Imperial 
                    attention, agreed to help him capture the ship in exchange for them leaving his people and his interests alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Falcon arrived, Luke was not among them, but Vader knew he could use his friends to lure his son to Bespin. 
                    Escorted by Fett, Vader waited for Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, and Calrissian. Whilst waiting in the Rinetta dining room, 
                    he was barged in upon by the Lepi smuggler Jaxxon T. Tumperakki, who quickly left after the Dark Lord and the 
                    smuggler stared at each other. A team of stormtroopers was then dispatched to arrest Tumperakki. When the Rebels 
                    arrived, Vader had them surrounded by stormtroopers, imprisoned—and, in the case of Captain Solo, tortured. Much 
                    to Calrissian's displeasure, Vader altered their deal, agreeing to let Fett take Solo and collect Jabba's bounty on 
                    him. Afterward, he inspected one of the city's carbon-freezing chambers, and deemed it adequate if crude, to freeze 
                    Luke for his journey to the Emperor, but at the danger of it being fatal, he had the facility tested on Captain Solo. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On his orders, Solo was frozen in carbonite; as he survived, Vader handed Solo over to Fett and ordered Organa, 
                    Chewbacca and C-3PO taken to his ship, while he awaited Luke at the facility. Once his son was separated from R2-D2 
                    and made his way to the carbon-freezing chamber, Vader appeared before him, and the two dueled. Luke held his own 
                    for much of the duel, but he was ultimately no match for Vader: as they moved to a reactor shaft and a catwalk, 
                    Luke managed to cut Vader's shoulder, only for Vader to slice off his right hand, which along with his old 
                    lightsaber fell through the shaft.

                    </figure>
                    Vader beckoned Luke to join him in the dark side, but Luke vehemently refused. Vader then told Luke that Kenobi had 
                    hidden from him the truth about his father, Anakin Skywalker, before revealing that he was, in fact, his father. 
                    Luke refused to believe the truth, but Vader continued to tempt his weakened son, offering Luke the chance to 
                    destroy the Emperor and "bring order to the galaxy," just as he tried to do with Padmé on Mustafar. He even pleaded 
                    with his son to come with him, but Luke chose likely death by plunging into the shaft.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While Luke was rescued by his friends on the Millennium Falcon, Vader returned to the Executor. As the freighter was 
                    unable to escape due to its disabled hyperdrive, Vader and Piett waited for the Falcon to enter tractor-beam range. 
                    During the pursuit, Vader reached out to Luke through the Force, telling him it was his destiny to come with him, 
                    calling him "son.". Yet the Falcon made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2. Although Piett feared Vader 
                    would kill him for his failure, Vader merely turned away from the viewport, not in anger, but in sadness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shortly after the Falcon's escape and its vital role in the Battle at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three, Vader chastised 
                    Commander Ellian Zahra for attempting to destroy the vessel during the engagement, stating that while Leia 
                    Organa would be an acceptable casualty, another passenger was of value to him. Vader further threatened consequence 
                    to Zahra should she report further of "partial success" before dismissing her. Upon learning that Vader had allowed 
                    Fett to take the carbon frozen Solo back to Jabba, ISB agent Andressa Divo was frustrated that the smuggler would 
                    not be brought to Imperial imprisonment, although she also decided she had no position to question Vader's orders.

                    Per his master's plan to counter the Alliance operation that sought to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile 
                    Battle Station Vader was sent to the Endor system to notify Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod of the Emperor's arrival, 
                    and that he was to complete its construction on time, even if he needed more men. Indeed, the Emperor arrived 
                    weeks later and was greeted by Vader, Jerjerrod, hundreds of officers and stormtroopers lined up to honor him. 
                    Satisfied with the Death Star's state, the Emperor sensed Vader's wish to continue his search for his son, but 
                    told him to have patience, much to Vader's displeasure. Nevertheless he complied, and remained on the Executor 
                    despite intelligence reports of the Alliance Fleet massing near Sullust. During his stay on the Super Star Destroyer, 
                    the Rebel shuttle Tydirium requested permission to land on the forest moon of Endor; Vader allowed it sensing Luke's 
                    presence in it.

                <h4 id="l6l2">One last duel</h4>

                <p>
                    Vader escorted his son to the Death Star and into the Emperor's throne room. Shortly afterward, the Alliance Fleet 
                    arrived to find that the SLD-26 planetary shield generator was still operational and protecting the Death Star. 
                    As the battle between the Imperial and Rebel fleets raged, and the Endor strike team sought to destroy the Endor 
                    base, the Emperor tempted Luke to give in to his anger. In a moment of weakness, Luke lashed out, but Vader stopped 
                    his strike and dueled him once again. Throughout the duel, the two seemed to be evenly matched, but Vader was not 
                    trying to kill Luke, only to lead him closer to the dark side. This succeeded when Luke used the dark side to 
                    overwhelm his father and kick him down several stairs. When the Emperor told him to use his anger again, 
                    Luke realized what he had done and took a more defensive position. Eventually, Vader telepathically sensed the 
                    existence of his daughter and Luke's twin sister, Leia, and threatened to corrupt her instead. Only then did his son 
                    lose control and viciously attack him, cutting Vader's right hand off and knocking him down.

                <p>
                    Vader was then betrayed by the Emperor, who demanded Luke to finish Vader and take Vader's place at his side.
                    Vader waited for Luke to kill him, as it was the way of the Sith to destroy the weak, and believed that 
                    Luke would replace him, just like Vader had replaced Dooku decades earlier. Luke, realizing that he was 
                    becoming what he sought to destroy, threw his lightsaber aside and declared himself a Jedi, just as 
                    Anakin Skywalker had been before him. Infuriated, the Emperor unleashed continuous streams of Force 
                    lightning against Luke, intending to torture him to death. Luke begged Vader to save him. Vader knew that his son 
                    would die, viewing it as the price Luke would pay for his weakness. However, he began to question whether it was 
                    really weakness, since Luke had shown him mercy. He also saw how Luke still believed that there was good in him. 
                    Vader became conflicted over whether to save his son, or continue to serve his master, similar to when he chose 
                    Sidious over Windu 23 years earlier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hearing his son's plea for help again, Vader returned to the light and chose to save Luke. He grabbed the Emperor 
                    with what was left of his arms and lifted his master high in the air, lumbering toward the reactor shaft. Surprised
                    but angered by his apprentice's betrayal, the Emperor turned a yet more powerful lightning attack on Vader, 
                    now Anakin once again; in his hatred, his only thought was to cause his now-former apprentice more pain, 
                    even though he could still have used his powers to save himself. At the cost of the Emperor heavily damaging his 
                    life-supporting armor, Anakin hurled his former master down into the reactor to his death. The persona of Darth 
                    Vader was no more, and Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight, was reborn. By killing Darth Sidious and ending the Sith's 
                    reign,[5] the redeemed Jedi brought balance to the Force and thus fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One, which 
                    Qui Gon Jinn had projected 35 years earlier.

                    Just before Calrissian on the Falcon and Wedge Antilles destroyed the Death Star's main reactor, 
                    Skywalker was carried by his son to the Imperial shuttle ST 321, where he asked Luke to remove his 
                    mask; for a moment, Anakin looked upon his son's face for the first and only time. He finally saw 
                    him not as a Jedi, or a threat, or a mistake, but as his and Amidala's son, and gave Luke a real 
                    smile—the smile that only his wife ever saw. As Kenobi and Yoda appeared to Anakin behind Luke, 
                    smiling down at the redeemed Skywalker, Luke insisted that he had to save him, but Skywalker 
                    told him he already had and asked him to tell his sister he had been right about him. He smiled at 
                    his son.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As he died, Skywalker tried to speak to Amidala, telling her of how their son had saved him before trying 
                    to apologize, but he passed on before he could finish the thought,dying in the arms of his son while 
                    Imperial forces panicked around them, unconcerned with the fate of their former lord. However, Anakin's 
                    soul would survive death; his heroic sacrifice allowed his spirit to be preserved in the Force by Kenobi 
                    and Yoda. With the death of Anakin Skywalker, Luke took his father's body aboard the shuttle and escaped 
                    just before the Death Star's destruction. Back on Endor, Skywalker built a funeral pyre for his redeemed 
                    father, and cremated him in the manner of a Jedi's funeral in solitude, for the sight of Vader's helmet 
                    consumed by fire would be cause for rejoicing to everyone but him. Having fulfilled his destiny and saving 
                    his son, Anakin joined Yoda and Obi Wan, once again a hero, though unsung to everyone except in the eyes 
                    of Luke.
                </p>

            <h2 id="anchor2">Personality and traits</h2>
            <p>
                As a child, Anakin Skywalker showed kindness and generosity, as exemplified by his willingness to risk 
                his life in a podrace to help Qui-Gon Jinn and Padmé Amidala depart Tatooine at a time of need. He made 
                a number of friends, and his best friend was a fellow slave boy named Kitster Banai. He was not shy to 
                express how he felt and showed a reluctance to leave those he loved behind. Indeed, Skywalker had a 
                deep-seated fear of loss, especially in regards to his mother, which Master Yoda sensed when he was 
                being tested by the Jedi Council. This fear of loss would follow Skywalker throughout his life and 
                eventually led him down the path of the dark side, particularly after the death of his mother, 
                Shmi, carrying sadness, anger and guilt in his heart for years to come.
                He also felt that fear towards his friends, noticing when he believed that Obi-Wan was killed by the 
                bounty hunter Rako Hardeen, leading him to the dark side. But upon discovering that he was a ruse to 
                prevent Chancellor Palpatine's kidnapping, he felt betrayed for not telling him sooner, and thus began 
                to distrust Obi-Wan and the Jedi.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon his conversion to the dark side, Skywalker's arrogant streak became even more prominent, and for a short time, 
                he believed himself to be even more powerful than Palpatine. During his early days as a Sith, Vader believed in 
                justice and would fight to bring it to the Empire at any cost. His impulsiveness and tendency to act in anger were 
                both magnified as well; for instance, when he discovered that Kenobi had stowed away on his wife's ship when she 
                came to Mustafar, he immediately assumed that she was conspiring with his former master and strangled her with the 
                Force. Despite this, Vader did experience a significant level of regret for the decisions that he had made to save 
                Amidala.

                However, all that changed following his defeat at Kenobi's hands. Having lost all that he had turned to 
                the dark side to preserve, and having no other path, he fully embraced the dark side and became, in 
                Palpatine's words, a "true Sith." Consequently, Vader devoted himself fully to furthering the 
                development of his relationship to the Force, and the expansion of his power. Both due to what Palpatine 
                taught him about the relationship between Sith master and apprentice and his own personal tendencies, 
                Vader in his early apprenticeship was completely devoted to the Emperor. However, as his power grew, 
                and particularly after learning of his son's existence, this devotion dwindled considerably.

                Despite being naturally extremely talented, Anakin Skywalker was initially lax with his lightsaber training, 
                though he believed that he could rival the Jedi Masters. Despite his relative laziness, Skywalker was the best 
                duelist in his class, even though he started later than his classmates. In his training he preferred lightsaber 
                combat over Force mastery, and he spent more time on the physical aspects of becoming a Jedi. By the time he was 
                nineteen, Skywalker was so gifted and skilled in dueling that he believed he already rivaled Master Yoda. When the
                 Clone Wars began Skywalker was a skilled enough duelist to contend against Count Dooku, who was one of the most 
                 skilled swordsmen in the galaxy. During the war, his frequent engagements in duels with individuals such as the 
                 informal Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress,Savage Opress, Count Dooku, and fallen Jedi Barriss Offee allowed him to 
                 greatly improve his capabilities with a lightsaber. By the end of the war, Skywalker had the skill to 
                 single-handedly defeat Dooku in combat, despite the fact that the Count was one of very few duelists who could 
                 hold his own against Yoda.

                Blessed with impressive reflexes that were typical of a Jedi, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn saw enormous potential 
                in the 9-year-old Skywalker and believed him to have been conceived by the Force itself. Indeed, when his blood 
                was tested, Skywalker's midi-chlorian count was off the scale—above 20,000, reportedly even greater than Yoda's. 
                When he was nine, Anakin was already skilled in having quick reflexes and precognition. This was something he 
                used to an advantage when he participated in pod racing. He was also able to sense what things were without 
                looking at them.

            <h3 id="a3l3">Other abilities</h3>
            <p>
                Even at a young age, Skywalker demonstrated a great aptitude for piloting, mechanics, and engineering. 
                He rebuilt the protocol droid C-3PO, an advanced droid fluent in over six million forms of communication, 
                as well as a functional podracer. Although during his adulthood he would rarely use his talent as a mechanic, 
                he kept the skill of repairing technology. In a deleted scene of the Clone Wars, Anakin also showed skills in 
                using blasters, taking out many opponents and having amazing accuracy/marksmanship.
