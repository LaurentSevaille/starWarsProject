            <p>
                The <b>Galactic Empire,</b> also known as the First Galactic Empire, the <b>Empire</b> and later as the
                Old Empire,was the fascist dictatorship that replaced the Galactic Republic at the end of the Clone
                Wars. Though
                the Empire rose to power by promising to bring order to the galaxy, it oversaw a period of harsh
                military rule and aggressive expansion. The subsequent Imperial Era would last only two decades, for it
                was eventually overthrown by the <a href="./Article.html?page=Rebellion">Alliance to Restore the
                    Republic</a> in the Galactic Civil War, but not before the sovereign star systems of the galaxy had
                been largely conquered and oppressed by the Empire's forces.
                <br><br>
                The First Galactic Empire traced its origins to a Sith conspiracy to destroy the Jedi Order and regain
                control over the galaxy. The Empire was secretly controlled by the Sith, for Galactic Emperor Palpatine
                was, in fact, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, whose reign was enforced by <a
                    href="./Article.html?page=Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>. Rising to power on a
                groundswell of populist support, and capitalizing on anti-Jedi and anti-droid sentiment and
                human-ethnocentrism manufactured by the destructive Clone Wars, Darth Sidious appointed himself Emperor
                at the end of the conflict by promising security and stability to the war-torn Republic. Gaining the
                overwhelming approval of the Galactic Senate, Sidious staged a coup by the Jedi, and oversaw their
                subsequent purge from the galaxy, assisted by his apprentice, Darth Vader.
                <br><br>
                The Empire stood virtually unchallenged during its rise to power, with the backing of the Imperial
                Senate and the spreading of its massive technological military force across the galaxy and began an
                major expansion and encroaching into the unexplored regions. At first, the Galactic Empire was a
                constitutional monarchy in basic theory, however it gradually evolved into a stratocracy as the power of
                the Imperial Senate waned. However, numerous insurgent cells sprang up against the Empire and gradually
                united to initiate a growing rebellion, winning its first major victory over Mustafar in 4 BBY. These
                rebel groups eventually formed the Rebel Alliance in 2 BBY, and achieved its first major victory with
                the theft of the <a href="./Article.html?page=Death Star">Death Star</a> plans on Scarif, which, in
                turn, led to the destruction of the Death Star at
                the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. The following years saw initial Alliance successes until a major Imperial
                victory on Hoth in 3 ABY, but the Empire suffered a devastating defeat one year later at the Battle of
                Endor. During the battle, Darth Sidious was slain at the hands of his former apprentice, the redeemed
                Anakin Skywalker, who himself died shortly thereafter, marking both the end of Sith rule and the
                downfall of the Empire.
                <br><br>
                With the Emperor death and Vader redemption, factionalism overcame the drying Empire as it fractured
                into breakaway fiefdoms led by splinter Moffs, admirals, and generals, many of whom ignored Grand Vizier
                Mas Amedda's authority at the capital and became warlords. The Imperial Navy came to be publicly led by
                loyalist Grand Admiral Rae Sloane, though she was a figurehead for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax and his
                Shadow Council. Ultimately, Rax seized control over the loyalist forces, removing Sloane from power and
                becoming Emperor-in-effect through his new position as Counselor to the Empire. Under Rax's command, the
                declining Empire made its final stand at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, ultimately losing to the New
                Republic and forced to sign war reparations and disarmament treaties. While several holdouts continued
                to resist, the defeated Empire formally capitulated to the New Republic with the signing of the Galactic
                Concordance.

            </div>
            The Imperial ideals of the Galactic Empire could be dated back to the Sith Empire of the Old Republic's time
            period. Following the defeat of the Sith during their final war with the Jedi Order, for at least a
            thousand years, the dominant governing body of the galaxy was the unicameral, parliamentary, and democratic
            Galactic Republic, which was governed by the Galactic Senate and led by an elected Supreme Chancellor.
            <br><br>
            In the last decades of its existence, the Republic Senate became embroiled in bureaucracy, rendering it
            woefully ineffectual as a governing body. Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith known publicly as Senator
            Sheev Palpatine of Naboo, privately lamented the declining state of the Senate, noting that the Republic was
            "not what it once was."
            <br><br>
            Thirteen years before the Republic's end as a democracy, Darth Sidious orchestrated the Invasion of Naboo by
            the Trade Federation in order to create a leadership crisis in the Senate. Sidious used the crisis to
            manipulate the then Queen of the Naboo, Padmé Amidala, into calling a Vote of No Confidence against sitting
            Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. The vote passed, and in the subsequent election, Sidious—in his public
            persona of Senator Palpatine of Naboo—secured the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic
            for himself through a strong sympathy vote. Ultimately, he would be the last individual to hold this
            office.
            <br><br>
            In the decade that followed, Sidious secretly manipulated galactic events to the extent that war became
            inevitable. Besides persuading a dead Jedi Master, Sifo-Dyas, to create a secret clone army, he also tasked
            his Sith apprentice, Darth Tyranus, with exacerbating political tensions in the Republic and engineering a
            Separatist Crisis. These actions would culminate in the outbreak of the Clone Wars held on Geonosis, the
            last conflict of the Republic, while Sidious himself "reluctantly" accepted emergency powers from the
            Senate.
            </p>

            <h3 id="l2">Birth of the New Order</h3>
            <p>
                Since the onset of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, the Republic endeavored to strengthen its security
                and stability through the creation of new organizations such as the Commission for the Protection of the
                Republic (COMPOR), which utilized propaganda to increase public morale, promote patriotism, and foster
                anti-Separatist sentiment within the general population. As the Republic became increasingly
                centralized, however, Chancellor Palpatine's powers continued to grow through additional assets ceded to
                the Office of the Chancellor, including the galactic banking system that was placed under his direct
                oversight. This gave Sidious the finance he needed to build his empire.
                <br><br>

                <figcaption>The Jedi, having discovered Palpatine's <br> secret identity, confronted the <br> chancellor
                    in his office on Coruscant.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            The Chancellor remained a popular leader for the duration of the war, having managed to stay in office
            at the will of the Senate for longer than his term permitted. As he consolidated and centralized his own
            power, his influence expanded to an unprecedented level while the Republic shifted from a democratic
            government to an increasingly militarized and authoritarian regime on the grounds of security and
            stability. In addition to his authority as Commander-in-Chief of the Republic Military, the Chancellor
            exerted more control over the Senate, the courts, and even the media with HoloNet News becoming a
            state-run program in order to ensure that information would not be compromised by the Confederacy of
            Independent Systems. Sidious' hold over the Republic further expanded with additional amendments to the
            Galactic Constitution while public support for the Jedi weakened as the war carried on, paving
            the way for his ultimate ascension as Emperor of the galaxy.
            <br><br>
            As the war neared its end in 19 BBY, the Jedi Order had grown skeptical about the Chancellor
            after his accumulation of emergency power. They began to suspect that a plot to destroy the Jedi was
            close to fruition. The ruling council started discussing forcibly removing Palpatine from office and
            temporarily overseeing the Senate in order to maintain political stability during the transition period.
            However, the Jedi learned of Palpatine's true identity as Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious.
            Following an attempt to arrest him, a brief but vicious fight ensued in which Sidious killed several
            Jedi and was himself visibly injured. The intercession of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who was a
            personal friend of Chancellor Palpatine and already disillusioned with both the Order and the war,
            ensured Sidious' victory. The prodigal Jedi was turned to the dark side of the Force, while Sidious had
            a pretext upon which to turn the Republic against the Jedi.
            <br><br>
            Darth Sidious immediately purged the Jedi Order, issuing to the clone army Order 66: to exterminate all
            Jedi. With this command programmed into the clones since their births on Kamino, the clone troopers
            immediately turned on their Jedi commanders and exterminated the vast majority of the Jedi Order in an
            instant. Meanwhile, Anakin Skywalker—rechristened as Sidious' new Sith apprentice Darth Vader—attacked
            the Jedi Temple and wiped out what remained of the Order.
            <br><br>

                    ascension as Emperor of the galaxy.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Despite their Order being wiped out, certain Jedi survived the initial purge. Many of them went into
            hiding after Grand Master Yoda and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi fought their way into the Temple and
            transmitted a holographic message warning the other Jedi about the Republic trap waiting for them there,
            right before the two Masters failed to destroy the Sith and headed into exile themselves. Some of
            them, however, were initially hunted down and either killed, taken prisoner or turned to the dark side
            as part of an agency of dark side adepts known as the Inquisitorius.
            <br><br>
            Shortly afterwards, Sidious turned his eyes to the Confederacy of Independent Systems and dispatched
            Darth Vader to wipe out Nute Gunray and the rest of the Separatist government leaders on Mustafar,
            following which Imperial financier Arsin Crassus plundered the Trade Federation's accounts to fund the
            new Imperial government. Now able to demonstrate threats to the Republic from both within and
            without, a visibly injured and scarred Sidious addressed the Galactic Senate to announce the reforms
            which had been his plan since the beginning. To the thunderous applause of the Senators, Sidious—known
            publicly as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine—announced that in order to preserve security and continued
            stability, the Republic would be reorganized into the First Galactic Empire and proclaimed himself as
            Galactic Emperor.

            </figure>
            At some point during its reign, the Empire undertook an expansion effort known simply as the Imperial
            expansion. It was during this time that they constructed a military installation on the volcanic world
            of Nevarro.
            <br><br>
            In total secrecy, the Empire took over construction of a massive battle station with enough firepower to
            destroy an entire planet, later known simply as the Death Star, that had formerly been a Separatist
            project engineered by Geonosian archduke Poggle the Lesser's hive colony for Count Dooku, who was
            entrusted with the project's plans for safekeeping throughout the Clone Wars, with supplies coming from
            various planets and locations such as Sentinel Base and Geonosis. During the Clone War, the Republic had
            begun work on the battle station.
            <br><br>
            As the Galactic Empire grew, Sidious moved closer to his ultimate plan of ruling the entire galaxy and
            unlocking the secrets of the Sith Masters who had come before him. With the near extermination of the Jedi
            Order and the Empire swelling in size and strength, the Emperor ultimately planned to possess the powers of
            the dark side to reshape reality itself into something of his own creation, and an omnipotent Empire would
            allow all the galaxy's inhabitants to be held in his dark embrace.

                This aggressive dislocation of persons and high tax rate eventually led to the development of a small
                and localized, albeit serious upheaval in 5 BBY against Imperial authority on Lothal. Although
                the other separate insurgencies across the Imperial territories was of little consequence, the Emperor
                did foresee a new threat rising against the Empire—the children of the Force. But the Empire overall did
                not fear that the various rebel cells could unite and form a more potent menace against the Empire and
                its interests in the Outer Rim. Imperial Military command maintained a list of known Rebel sympathizers
                on several Outer Rim worlds, including Lothal, but most of them were not arrested due to their having
                powerful allies in the Senate, a known hotbed of corruption and decadence.
                <br><br>
                In the aftermath of the victory on Lothal, Admiral Konstantine and the Imperial Navy continued to
                securing the Outer Rim and also hunting for these rebels. He was accompanied by Agent Kallus, who also
                had experience dealing with these rebels during the revolt on Lothal who had traveled to the desert
                planet of Seelos to make contact with several retired clone troopers: Rex, Wolffe, and Gregor and hoped
                to win them over to their cause but Wolffe who distrusted the rebels sent a coded transmission that was
                picked up by the Relentless.
                <br><br>
                Lacking a permanent base, one rebel group—the Phoenix Squadron—hid in several spaceports scattered
                across the planet Garel, but the Empire learned of the rebel presence there and sent a fleet to crush
                them with most retreating. Following the losses on Garel, Imperial Senator Organa sent his adopted
                daughter Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan to deliver three Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvettes to the
                Rebellion. Since the Alderaanians could not be seen directly supporting the Phoenix rebels, Bail
                arranged for Leia to deliver the vessels to Lothal, where in secret the rebels would "steal" the ships.
                However, the local Imperial commander Yogar Lyste had fitted the Hammerhead corvettes with gravity
                locks, but this failed when the rebels managed to steal the vessel during a skirmish with Imperial
                forces.
                <br><br>
                With the Empire hunting down the rebels throughout the Outer Rim Territories, the rebels decided to
                create a new route through the Lothal sector. Sabine identified the Concord Dawn system as a viable
                route that the rebels could use. The system was home to the Mandalorian Protectors, a Mandalorian
                faction that was led by Fenn Rau, a veteran of the Clone Wars. Commander Sato sent Phoenix Leader Hera
                and Sabine on a mission to negotiate safe passage through the Concord Dawn system with Rau. However, Rau
                had already aligned the Protectors with the Empire and attacked Hera's mission, seriously wounding Hera
                and killing at least one Phoenix Squadron pilot. In retaliation, Sabine and Kanan infiltrated the
                Protectors' camp on the third moon of Concord Dawn and destroyed their Fang-class fighters. The rebels
                also managed to capture Rau, who agreed to give the rebels safe passage through the Concord Dawn system
                in return for keeping his capture a secret from the Empire.

            With full-scale rebellion on the horizon, Imperial Senator Mon Mothma would openly betray the Empire by
            seeking to unite the various rebellions cells into one organization. She began by firstly publicly
            condemning the reign of Emperor Palpatine after the Ghorman Massacre which led to Commander Vult Skerris
            leading the effort for her capture in the Archeon Nebula. However, the mission ended in failure, and she
            was able to escape. This led to her broadcasting a speech to rebels across the galaxy over Dantooine,
            which led to the formation of various rebel cells into the alliance to restore the Galactic Republic
            and, along with her resignation from the Imperial Senate, the beginning of a true united rebellion.
            <br><br>
            Soon after its founding, the Rebel Alliance pressed on with the planned operation on Lothal by stealing
            clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau station on Killun 71 to allow their forces to mount a
            successful attack on the Empire. However, the planned rebel attack on Lothal would not go forward
            thanks to Thrawn, who had discovered the location of Chopper Base, the headquarters of the Phoenix
            Group. Thrawn's fleet then blockaded Atollon and inflicted heavy casualties on rebel forces. Thrawn then
            launched a ground assault after an orbital bombardment. Meanwhile, Ezra, who had escaped the fighting,
            succeeded in enlisting the help of Clan Wren.
            <br><br>
            In response, Governor Pryce dispatched Jumptroopers, but these reinforcements failed to stop the
            Mandalorians from destroying the last Interdictor cruiser. Despite Thrawn storming Chopper Base, the
            rebels and Imperials were attacked by an angry Bendu, an enigmatic being that was living on Atollon, who
            used his Force powers to devastate the rebel base before being subdued by Thrawn. The surviving rebel
            and Mandalorian forces then fled the battle as the Empire wiped out the Phoenix Squadron; however, the
            Empire was still unaware of the true scale of the Rebel Alliance.
            <br><br>
            The rebels continued their campaign and mounted successful raids on both Jalindi and the Faos Station.
            The Empire failed to stop both the Partisan and Spectre efforts, resulting in the loss of Commander Brom
            Titus and Captain Slavin. On Lothal, the Imperial Security Bureau conducted a successful raid against a
            suspected rebel cell allied with the Spectres.

            Imperial forces commanded by Darth Vader captured one of the leaders of the Alliance and the one who
            possessed the plans, Princess of Alderaan Leia Organa—who, unknown to Vader, was his own
            daughter. While nearly all of the old institutions of the Republic had been swept away in the
            intervening decades, this provided Sidious the opportunity to finally wipe away the last vestiges of the
            old democracy, and dissolve the Imperial Senate permanently. This brought governance of the various
            systems of the Empire directly under the purview of the Regional Governors and the Imperial Military.
            <br><br>
            Organa's presence, and her refusal to give up the location of the Alliance's base, precipitated Grand
            Moff Tarkin's decision to test-fire the newly completed Death Star's primary weapon on her homeworld,
            Alderaan. In an instant, the Imperial Military's superweapon utterly destroyed the populous, influential
            world. In so doing, Tarkin hoped not only to force Organa to submit but also to strike fear into any
            others who sought to rebel against Imperial rule. Soon after the destruction of Alderaan, dubbed "the
            Disaster" by Alderaanian refugees, vigils for the dead were held on Coruscant's Level 3204, with many on
            the level having formerly lived on Alderaan. However, as soon as the circumstances behind the event
            became clear, the once-peaceful vigils turned into violent riots, with many calling for justice and
            revolution against the Empire. Imperial stormtroopers and Coruscant underworld police were soon called
            in to restore the peace, and began arresting and eventually relocating those who questioned Imperial
            rule.

            </figure>
            Eventually, Organa was rescued from the Death Star by the unlikely alliance of smuggler Han Solo, her
            unknowing twin brother Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who sacrificed himself in his duel with Darth
            Vader. The group escaped the Imperial fortress and fled to the Alliance base on Yavin 4, pursued by the
            Death Star. At Yavin 4, the Empire and the Rebels engaged in a major battle, with the fate of the
            rebellion hanging in the balance. Despite destroying a great many of the Alliance's starfighters, the
            battle ultimately ended up a major defeat for the Imperial forces, when Skywalker fired the shot which
            destroyed the Death Star. This marked the Rebellion's first major victory against the Empire.
            <br><br>
            Now viewing the growing Alliance as a credible threat, Sidious issued a communiqué the morning after the
            Death Star's destruction ordering all ongoing ISB operations be superseded for the immediate detention
            of known and suspected rebel sympathizers. Admiral Kendal Ozzel ordered the fleet into battle
            readiness. To keep the Rebellion off balance, the Empire engaged in rushed and scrambled offenses
            across the galaxy and raided spice worlds such as Kerev Doi in an attempt to cut off possible sources of
            income for the Alliance. With major military redeployments occurring around the clock, the Imperial
            Military began to mobilize for a full-scale galactic war, while the Rebellion began to push into the
            populous Imperial Mid Rim in a failed operation that only months later would become known as the Mid Rim
            Retreat, its ultimate demise owing in large part to the Empire's numerical superiority.

            <h4 id="l4l5">Search for Luke Skywalker</h4>
            <p>
                While the Rebellion made a drive to defeat the Empire, Vader meanwhile searched for Luke Skywalker. The
                Empire attempted to pin down rebel activity, but were unable to stop them from seizing control of the
                Harbinger from the grip of the Imperial Navy. However, the Empire started a counterattack and
                prevented rebel guerrilla and military desultory raids that had occurred in the aftermath of
                Yavin. Further Imperial success came on the mineral planet Crait, where the Empire
                confronted the Alliance after an attack on the Alliance Fleet as they searched out a possible new rebel
                base.
                <br><br>
                The Rebellion embarked on a massive military campaign to liberate hundreds of worlds under Imperial
                control by pushing into the heavily populated Mid Rim. With thousands of starships, hundreds of battle
                groups and dozens of worlds involved in the operation, it was initially met with stunning success as
                Imperial forces, unprepared for such a large-scale operation and shattered from the recent shake-ups in
                the Imperial hierarchy, fell back from world to world, allowing the Rebellion to press further into
                Imperial space. Taking the factory-deserts of Phorsa Gedd and the Ducal Palace of Bamayar, the
                Rebellion's advance gradually slowed as Imperial resistance stiffened. Eighteen months into the
                operation, fearing to overextend the fleet and occupied with the consolidation of worlds now under Rebel
                control, High Command ordered for the defense of occupied territories, and shortly thereafter the slow
                withdrawal of Alliance military resources back towards the Outer Rim.

            </figure>
            While the loss of both Tarkin and the Death Star itself were significant, Imperial resolve toward
            putting down the rebellion only increased. For the next three and a half years, Imperial forces under
            the direct command of Darth Vader relentlessly pursued the Alliance. While the hunt was personal for
            Vader, having learned that the young rebel Skywalker was actually his son, the Imperial Military
            nevertheless scoured the galaxy with Imperial probe droids.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, the Empire's search came to fruition when one of its probe droids located the Alliance's new
            base on the ice planet Hoth. The massive Imperial fleet, led by the command ship Executor, arrived in
            the system and deployed ground forces at the Moorsh Moraine, a glacial feature on the planet in
            preparation for a major assault on the Alliance forces at Echo Base. Overwhelmed, the rebels were forced
            to flee, and the Empire claimed a decisive victory.
            <br><br>
            The Imperial pursuit of the rebels, however, did not stop at Hoth. The Imperial fleet continued to chase
            down the fleeing rebels, pursuing Leia Organa and Han Solo into the Hoth asteroid belt. Though Solo's
            ship, the Millennium Falcon, eluded Imperial pursuit, Vader engaged the services of bounty hunters to
            track down the fleeing Alliance leadership.
            </p>

            <h4 id="l4l7">Trap on Cloud City</h4>
            <p>
                One of these bounty hunters, Boba Fett, tracked Organa and Solo to Cloud City on Bespin, enabling
                Imperial forces to capture them and lay a trap for Luke Skywalker. The trap was eventually sprung, and
                Skywalker learned of his true relation to Vader, but the Imperial forces found themselves betrayed and,
                at least initially, overwhelmed by Cloud City's local authorities. The rebel leaders escaped Imperial
                custody again, but not without cost. Skywalker was maimed in a duel with Vader, while Solo was frozen in
                carbonite and handed over to the bounty hunter. Battered and bruised, the Alliance was once again in
                flight from pursuing Imperial forces.
                <br><br>
                Following the disastrous Battle of Hoth, the Alliance Fleet was scattered across the galaxy, and the
                absence of clear orders and the condition of Alliance High Command put the movement into its most
                critical stage in the war effort. With Imperial forces required to maintain the Mid Rim border and
                combat active war zones, vast numbers of Imperial forces from the Core Worlds were deployed to finally
                quash the Rebellion in the Outer Rim. This redeployment, however, left the Core's defenses enervated if
                only by a slight margin. Knowing the Empire's reliance on the Imperial shipyards at Kuat and their vital
                importance in planetary containment and fast infantry deployment, the Rebel Sixty-First Mobile Infantry
                launched Operation Ringbreaker, an initiative designed to destroy the Empire's orbital facilities at
                Kuat. Ultimately, the plan faltered and ended on Sullust owing to logistical concerns.

            Six months after the Rebellion's catastrophic loss at Hoth, the Rebel Fleet split into small fragments
            across the galaxy in an attempt to avoid another propaganda victory for the Empire, further extending
            the Imperial fleet in an effort to engage them. Despite its previous advantages following the Battle of
            Yavin, the Rebellion was sitting on a knife's edge after learning of Darth Sidious constructing another
            battle station. Following the loss of the first Death Star, the Emperor made clear his determination to
            create another planet-shattering space station, this time more powerful than the first.
            <br><br>
            Utilizing S-thread boosters to carve a secret hyperspace lane through the Outer Rim, the Emperor planned
            to destroy the rebels in a doomed engagement over the forest moon of Endor, construction site of the
            Death Star II, which, unbeknownst to the rebels, had a fully operational superlaser. Following the
            presumed destruction of a sizable portion of the Alliance's military capabilities, the Emperor planned
            to deploy some of the largest invasion fleets seen in centuries to blockade the known rebel strongholds
            of Mon Cala and Chandrila until the Death Star could destroy them, successfully eliminating any hope of
            a successful galactic resistance and thus permanently ending the Alliance to Restore the Republic
            through sheer terror and intimidation.
            </p>

            <h4 id="l4l9">Leaking secrets</h4>
            <p>
                With the Alliance Fleet assembling over Sullust, the Emperor decided to proactively approach the Rebel
                problem. Rather than guard the station's secrets, as with the first Death Star, Sidious opted to leak
                just enough information to bait the Alliance into striking at the station before it was
                completed—including the fact that he would be overseeing the final stages of the station's construction
                personally. After the Bothan Spynet successfully transmitted intelligence regarding the Empire's new
                and improved Death Star to Alliance High Command, an emergency summit was held on the remote trade world
                of Zastiga, far from the Galactic Core.
                <br><br>
                There, Rebellion leaders and generals were to be informed of the construction of the second Death Star
                located over Endor which, they knew, had to be destroyed before it became operational. Needing to buy
                time for the scattered fleet to assemble over Sullust, Princess Leia Organa devised a strategy—Operation
                Yellow Moon—to divert Imperial attention to her instead of the upcoming mission to Endor.
                Ultimately, with the successful completion of Yellow Moon, the Rebel Alliance had gained valuable time
                for its now consolidated fleet to finally be able to strike at an incomplete Death Star.
                <br><br>
                Unknown to the Rebels, large portions of the Imperial Starfleet had already begun massing in the Hudalla
                system, while Imperial engineers had ensured that the new Death Star's main weapon was fully
                operational. Eventually, Imperial Military command had discreetly moved the gathered warships to a
                staging point on the far side of Endor's moon, where the Death Star was orbiting. Simultaneously, a
                legion of Imperial troops was deployed on the surface to stop any attempt at sabotaging the station's
                ground-based SLD-26 planetary shield generator, which neutralized any attempt at directly assaulting the
                station.

            </figure>
            Imperial intelligence reports indicated that Sidious' trap was indeed well underway when it was
            discovered that the Rebel fleet was massing at Sullust, as a staging ground for their strike at Endor.
            Per the Emperor's design and command, Imperial Military authorities were ordered to ignore the buildup
            so that the Rebels would commit their entire force to a doomed attack. When the Alliance fleet arrived
            en masse, the Emperor's trap was sprung. The Rebel ground forces had taken the bait and been captured,
            allowing the Death Star's shield to remain active, while the Imperial fleet moved into position to trap
            the Rebels. With the Alliance Fleet trapped between the bulk of the Imperial fleet and a shielded, fully
            operational Death Star, victory for the Empire seemed assured.
            <br><br>
            On the surface of Endor, the tables were turned on the Imperial forces when they were unexpectedly
            attacked by the planet's indigenous Ewok population, who had allied themselves with the Rebels, giving
            the Alliance ground forces a free hand to destroy the Death Star's shield generator. With the shield
            down, Alliance starfighters were able to launch an assault on the Imperial station's reactor core.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, aboard the station, a blow of an entirely different kind was struck against the Empire. The
            Emperor tried to replace Vader with a captive Luke Skywalker, the latter now being a Jedi, but Luke
            convinced Darth Vader to turn on his master. Vader—once again Anakin Skywalker—seized the Imperial head
            of state and hurled him down a shaft to his assumed death. Soon after, the Rebel starfighters
            successfully attacked the Death Star's reactor core. The station was destroyed—like its predecessor,
            lost with all hands. Due to the injuries he sustained in the process of overthrowing the Emperor, the
            redeemed Anakin died shortly after, but not before making peace with Luke. With the apparent loss of
            both the Emperor and his right-hand man, Vader, the destruction of the Death Star itself, and
            significant losses inflicted on the Imperial fleet, the Imperial remnants were forced to withdraw to the
            Annaj system. The Empire had suffered a decisive defeat.

            <h3 id="l5">The Empire's end</h3>
            <p>
                The Empire disintegrated with the death of Rax, the disappearance of Sloane, and the failure of the
                Imperial counteroffensive which ended with the loyalists' catastrophic defeat in the Battle of
                Jakku. The Empire forever changed as it was pushed back to a handful of sectors on the fringe of the
                Outer Rim, containing only a small fraction of the galaxy's population and industrial base. These
                sectors were a heavily fortified final redoubt, and the New Republic deemed that they posed too minor of
                a threat to justify the high cost in life that liberating them would require.
                <br><br>
                The New Republic then forced Grand Vizier Amedda to capitulate the Empire and settle for the Galactic
                Concordance on Chandrila, a humiliating armistice agreement which imposed strict disarmament plans and
                punishing reparations on the Empire. Treaty stipulations included outlawing the recruitment and
                mobilization of the Stormtrooper Corps, paying heavy war reparations, adhering to strict disarmament
                treaties, abandoning the numerous Imperial Academies scattered across the Empire, banning torture,
                and ceding its capital of Coruscant to the Republic.
                <br><br>
                Chancellor Mothma then issued another declaration designating all surviving officers war criminals,
                though she granted conditional pardons to all civilian functionaries including Amedda, provided they
                complied with the Concordance. While regulating what remained of the Empire's once-mighty
                military-industrial complex, thus limiting its ability to wage war, the treaty did permit elements of
                the Imperial Navy to remain in pre-determined boundaries in the Core Worlds, Colonies, and the Inner
                Rim. At the command of the Republic, they were recalled to the Core; however, some did not obey.
