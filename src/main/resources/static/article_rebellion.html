            <p>
                The Alliance to Restore the Republic (2 BBY–4 ABY), commonly known as the Rebel Alliance, Alliance, the
                Rebellion, and rarely the Separatists, was a resistance movement formed by Bail Prestor Organa and Mon
                Mothma to oppose the reign of the <a href="./Article.html?page=Empire">Galactic Empire</a>. The Alliance
                was formed from a less organized
                movement to oppose the Empire that existed, which was secretly led by Organa. This early group came
                together from a number of rebel cells, including the crew of the Ghost and the Phoenix Cell. The Atrivis
                Resistance Group was one of the first cells to join what Mothma began calling "the Alliance" before the
                formal formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The Alliance was publicly and formally
                declared with the Declaration of the Rebel Alliance.
                <br><br>
                The Alliance and the cells before it were born from the overall discontent within the Empire of those
                who wished the Old Republic restored. Its efforts were led by renegade members in the Imperial Senate
                such as Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and later, his daughter <a href="./Article.html?page=Leia Organa">Leia
                    Organa,</a> and its members were citizens of
                the Empire and defectors from the Imperial Military such as Jan Dodonna, Ryder Azadi, and Wedge
                Antilles. Founded and united by Organa and Ahsoka Tano, the early rebels were assisted by surviving
                Jedi, such as Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan, Ezra Bridger. Clone Wars veterans, such as Captain Rex also
                assisted in the initial movement.
                <br><br>
                As opposed to waging all-out war, the Alliance waged a war of attrition against the Empire, establishing
                small bases across the galaxy instead of controlling an entire planet.
                <br><br>
                When the Alliance stole the plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the <a
                    href="./Article.html?page=Death Star">Death Star</a>, and destroyed the
                space station in the Battle of Yavin with the help of <a href="./Article.html?page=Luke Skywalker">Luke
                    Skywalker</a>, the tide of the war began to turn,
                and the Rebel threat began to prove a severe thorn in the Empire's side. The Rebellion continued to
                engage in battles with the Empire in the Galactic Civil War. However, under the command of <a
                    href="./Article.html?page=Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>,
                the Imperial forces succeeded in defeating the Alliance on Hoth, forcing the Alliance to scatter its
                forces in order to survive.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, the Alliance prevailed against the Empire and critically damaged it by launching an attack
                against the second Death Star during its construction in what would become the Battle of Endor. Not only
                did the Alliance manage to destroy the battle station, but the Imperial Navy was severely crippled by
                the loss of one of its Super Star Destroyers, and Luke Skywalker redeemed his father, Darth Vader, who
                killed Emperor Sheev Palpatine, before dying himself in the battle. The Alliance was soon reorganized
                into the fledgling New Republic, which went on to defeat the Empire at the Battle of Jakku one year
                after Endor and force the Empire to surrender by signing the Galactic Concordance, effectively ending
                the war.
                <br><br>
                By the time of the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance had chosen a red starbird as its symbol and logo.

            While the Alliance to Restore the Republic was a resistance movement opposed to the tyranny of the Galactic
            Empire and its New Order, its roots predated the actual birth of the Empire, when the Galactic Republic was
            in its last years of existence. During the Clone Wars, a conflict that pitted the Republic against the
            Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Jedi Order helped create resistance units on Separatist-held
            worlds as part of a plan proposed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, one example being the Onderon rebels.
            However, it was not for many more years that such rebel cells would coalesce into a single Rebellion with a
            centralized leadership.

            </figure>
            <br><br>
            Also during the Clone Wars, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine had managed to obtain many emergency powers
            from the Galactic Senate, which caused certain members of the Chancellor's own Loyalist Committee, including
            Bail Prestor Organa of Alderaan, Padmé Amidala of Naboo, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila, to start to
            complain about the chief of state's conduct. The discontented senatorial representatives ended up
            forming the Delegation of 2,000. They signed the Petition of 2,000, a document that formally expressed its
            signatories' concerns with Palpatine's rule and called for him to relinquish his emergency powers as soon as
            possible. Senator Meena Tills of Mon Cala was among the petitioners.
            <br><br>
            Shortly thereafter, the Clone Wars was brought to an end. Far from relinquishing his dictatorial status,
            Chancellor Palpatine unilaterally abolished the Republic in front of the whole Senate and anointed himself
            the Galactic Emperor, thus transforming the democratic government into an authoritarian regime, the Galactic
            Empire. Unbeknownst to most of the galactic community, the self-promoted Emperor Palpatine was in fact the
            Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who had masterminded the Clone Wars so that he could gain power and overthrow the
            Republic. The Emperor immediately started to subvert democracy in the galaxy and declared the peacekeeping
            Jedi Knights enemies of the state. In the immediate aftermath of the Clone Wars and Senator Amidala's
            death at the hands of her husband, Darth Vader, the identity adopted by Anakin Skywalker when he became
            Sidious's Sith apprentice, Senators Organa and Mothma started working in secret to overthrow the Empire.

            </figure>
            The Rebel Alliance formally came into existence after Senator Mon Mothma resigned from the Imperial Senate
            and denounced the Emperor for his role in the Ghorman Massacre. With the help of Phoenix Leader Hera
            Syndulla and her Spectres, Mothma escaped Thrawn's forces by traveling through the dangerous Archeon pass to
            reach Dantooine. There, Mon Mothma gave a HoloNet speech calling for the galaxy to rise up in rebellion
            against the Empire. Mothma's message was heard by the scattered rebel cells throughout the galaxy including
            Lothal and Atollon. The rebel fleet converged above Dantooine, and the various cells and factions were
            unified into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, which officially began the Galactic Civil War.
            <br><br>
            As part of the planned attack on Lothal, Syndulla dispatched the droids AP-5 and Chopper along with the
            former Imperial cadet Wedge Antilles to steal clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau station on
            the moon Killun 71. During the course of the mission, Chopper was hijacked by a group of Imperial slicers
            and intelligence officers led by LT-319, who were based aboard an IGV-55 surveillance vessel. LT-319 tried
            to use Chopper to kill the Spectres and find the location of Chopper Base. However, Hera managed to
            reprogram Chopper and transmitted a data surge that destroyed the Imperial surveillance vessel.
            <br><br>
            Having obtained the clearance codes, the Phoenix Squadron began training for their mission to Lothal. Ezra
            Bridger was briefly distracted when he departed with Chopper on an errant mission to Tatooine to save
            Obi-Wan Kenobi from the former Sith apprentice Maul. Kenobi told Bridger to return to his place with the
            Rebellion and defeated Maul in combat. At some stage of its existence, the Rebel Alliance undertook an
            assault on Vivonah and the slaughter on Noult, which were decried as terrorist actions by rebel enemies.

            By 0 BBY, the Alliance had become a full-fledged resistance movement headed by Bail Organa and Mon
            Mothma, with the latter bearing the title of Chancellor, was established. Now in possession of a
            respectable starfleet that included T-65B X-wing starfighters, BTL-A4 Y-wing assault
            starfighter/bombers, A-wing starfighters, and large ships that included MC80 Star Cruisers, at least one
            MC75 Star Cruiser, EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, and various corvettes, gunships, and transports, the
            Alliance was finally able to fight the Empire on better terms. At the time, the Alliance was
            headquartered on the lush moon of Yavin 4, in an ancient stone structure known as the Great Temple.
            <br><br>
            Leia Organa, the surrogate daughter of Bail Organa and crown princess of Alderaan, had succeeded her
            adopted father in the Imperial Senate and was also a secret member of the Alliance. Prominent
            Alliance war leaders of the time included General Jan Dodonna and Admiral Gial Ackbar. Some of the
            Empire's Joint Chiefs, like General Cassio Tagge, realized the full threat of what they called "the
            Rebellion." Others, like Admiral Conan Antonio Motti, believed in the infallibility of the Empire's
            might. The Imperials, in an attempt to avoid dissent and sympathy for the Rebellion amongst loyal
            Imperial citizens, ensured that, through the use of propaganda, they did not know how large of a threat
            the Alliance truly was, assuring them that it was merely an unorganized and vengeful terrorist
            organization.

            The Alliance's first major battle with the Galactic Empire was on the tropical planet of Scarif, in
            which the Alliance scored its first large-scale victory in the war. Prior to the battle, Alliance
            Intelligence intercepted information suggesting that renowned scientist Galen Erso was building an
            Imperial superweapon capable of destroying entire planets. Alliance leadership sent Galen Erso's
            daughter, Jyn Erso and Captain Cassian Andor to learn more about her father's involvement, and their
            subsequent efforts saw the Alliance discover the existence of the Death Star, as well as a fatal flaw in
            the design placed there by Galen Erso. During the Battle, the Alliance managed to steal the blueprints
            of the Death Star, which had just been completed after nearly two decades of work, from the Imperial
            satellite base on Scarif. The plans to the Death Star were then transported to Princess Leia Organa on
            the Tantive IV.

            Following the Battle of Scarif, Princess Leia's ship fell under Imperial attack over Tatooine, and she
            was captured by the dreaded Darth Vader himself, which prevented her from bringing the blueprints to her
            father back on Alderaan. She still managed to entrust the plans to the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, who
            escaped the ship in an escape pod and landed on Tatooine below. After Imperial Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin
            ordered the destruction of Alderaan with the Death Star's superlaser, Leia Organa was rescued from the
            battle station's jail by the crew of the Corellian YT-1300f light freighter Millennium Falcon, who
            returned her the two droids. The group—except for Obi-Wan Kenobi, who gave his life battling Darth
            Vader—escaped the Death Star aboard the Falcon and headed for the Alliance headquarters on Yavin 4,
            where the plans of Empire's superweapon were analyzed.
            <br><br>
            Having traced the fleeing rebels, the Empire discovered the location of the Alliance base, and the Death
            Star closed into Yavin 4. The Alliance then launched its assault against the battle station, with
            Princess Leia monitoring in the command center. Luke Skywalker joined the mission in his own way,
            piloting an X-wing under the call sign of Red Five. As the Empire readied to destroy Yavin 4 and the
            Alliance with a single blow of its superlaser, Han Solo unexpectedly saved Skywalker by blasting a group
            of Imperial TIE/ln starfighters that were giving chase. Skywalker managed to fire a proton torpedo into
            the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, destroying the battle station by exploiting its only weakness.
            <br><br>
            In the shadow of Yavin, the Alliance had won its first major tactical victory, but at an enormous cost
            in lives. In addition to the Alliance pilots who died during the assault, at least millions of
            Alderaanians had perished with their planet, Bail Organa among them. After an award ceremony during
            which Princess Leia presented the heroes of the day with medals of Bravery, Alliance General Dodonna
            made it his priority to have Yavin 4 evacuated. Now that the Empire knew their location, they had to
            find a new base of operations as soon as possible. Darth Vader became obsessed with finding the
            young rebel who had destroyed the Death Star right under his nose. Unbeknownst to him, until learning
            Luke's last name through Boba Fett, and the rebels at the time, he was in fact the biological father of
            both Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. Not long after the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel fleet relocated to
            the Pantora system.

                <figcaption>Battle of Hoth.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            In 3 ABY, one of the many Imperial probe droids searching the galaxy ended up discovering the Rebels'
            presence. The Imperial Death Squadron, Darth Vader's personal armada, headed for Hoth with a contingent
            of ground troops, ready to crush the rebellion once and for all. However, due to a mistake by the
            Imperial admiral Kendal Ozzel, the Alliance forces were warned of the Empire's arrival. The Rebels had
            time to activate the deflector shield protecting Echo Base, rendering orbital bombardment impossible. As
            the Alliance prepared for evacuation, Imperial troops disembarked on the surface of Hoth, beyond the
            range of the energy shields. Once there, several legions of snowtroopers advanced on Echo Base. A
            squadron of All Terrain Armored Transports under the command of General Maximilian Veers was tasked with
            destroying the massive generators powering the Rebel base's shield. Perimeter Outpost Delta fell first
            with Sergeant Hazram Namir, Roja, and Beak being forced to retreat back to the main base to find Captain
            Micha Evon and Everi Chalis.
            <br><br>
            Luke Skywalker, now a commander, led his Rogue Squadron of snowspeeders against General Veers' armored
            transports. By using a harpoon gun and tow-cable, the Rebels managed to bring down one of the
            transports, but Skywalker's snowspeeder was shot down. Unlike his gunner, Dak Ralter, the Rogue
            commander survived the accident. With the help of his lightsaber and a grenade, he still managed to
            destroy another walker. Despite the Rebels' best efforts to delay Veers' armored transports, the
            Imperial general successfully blew up the protective shield generator, allowing Darth Vader and his men
            to enter Echo Base. While the Rebel command personnel and material was loaded into transports and
            whisked away just in time, the unprepared Alliance soldiers engaged the Imperials in conventional
            warfare. Namir and his two men got back to the main base to find Chalis with and Captain Evon, who was
            unconscious. They then encountered Darth Vader who killed Captain Evon, Roja, and Beak. Namir and Chalis
            escaped on a shuttle with Chalis' clearance codes.
            <br><br>
            Unable to reach a transport, Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the droid C-3PO took their
            flight in the Millennium Falcon. The Alliance delayed the Imperial troops long enough to get its most
            important staff off the planet, and its ground-based ion cannon temporarily disabled all ships of the
            Imperial Death Squadron, preventing them from attacking the escaping transports. All in all, the Empire
            still won a major victory on Hoth, as the Alliance was routed from its base once again and barely
            escaped Death Squadron's blockade. The Imperial victory left the Alliance scattered and General
            Philap Bygar was killed during or after the battle when running from the Imperials.

            <h4 id="l3l2">The Second Death Star</h4>
            <p>
                Rebounding from their losses at Hoth after Operation Starlight, the Rebel Alliance formally revealed its
                survival by attacking the Imperial Unity Day parade on Bar'leth, which was being broadcast to the entire
                galaxy. The victory was therefore incredibly public and showcased that the Rebels took care to not hurt
                civilians. Sometime between 3 ABY and 4 ABY, the Bothan Spynet found information confirming
                the existence of a second Death Star, DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, and immediately began to
                dig for more information. The Emperor found out about this and sought to set a trap for the Alliance. He
                let more information be fed more to the Bothans, with many of them dying in order to get it, and hid the
                fact that the Death Star's superlaser was complete. The new information revealed the location of the
                Death Star, Endor, the shield protecting it and the shafts within it big enough for starfighters to pass
                through to the core.
                <br><br>
                When the Alliance High Command got this information, they launched Operation Yellow Moon in order to
                distract Imperial forces across the galaxy. This was led by Princess Organa and her strike team.
                Meanwhile, the rebels on the MC80 Star Cruiser Invincible Faith had intercepted a message from Moff
                Raythe, which would reveal the Emperor's trap if they decrypted it in time, but they had also captured
                Commander Iden Versio of the Empire's Inferno Squad, who had let it happen so she could get rid of the
                message. She broke free, forced her way through the ship and deleted the message making sure no-one in
                the Alliance could know about the trap. Iden escaped with the help of the other members of Inferno
                Squad.

                <figcaption>The Death Star II in orbit over <br> Endor during the Battle of Endor.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            In 4 ABY, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was determined to deal a fatal blow to Emperor
            Palpatine's tyranny. After having learned that the Empire had secretly begun construction on a second
            Death Star even more powerful than the first one, the Alliance fleet rendezvoused near Sullust to plan
            an attack. Thanks to its Bothan spies, the Alliance had learned that Palpatine himself was to oversee
            the final construction stages of the new battle station.
            <br><br>
            It was decided that a rebel strike team led by Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo, and Chewbacca
            would land on Endor in a stolen Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, with the mission to deactivate the Death
            Star's energy defense shield. Little did they know that they had fallen into a trap. When they reached
            the shield's bunker, the Imperial army was waiting for them. In orbit of Endor, the Alliance fleet was
            ambushed by a large Imperial armada led by the Super Star Destroyer Executor that emerged from
            hyperspace. Unable to attack the Death Star until its shield was destroyed, the rebel fleet focused its
            attack on the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although its starfighters were able to maneuver easily around
            the Death Star, they were still vulnerable to the battle station's superlaser, which destroyed the
            Liberty and the Nautilian.
            <br><br>
            On Endor, the rebel strike team ended up allying with the native Ewoks, who used their knowledge of
            their homeworld's forests to take the Imperial army by surprise. The strike team was finally able to
            destroy the shield generator after a lengthy ground battle, allowing its starfleet to attack the
            Empire's dreaded superweapon. The Alliance general Lando Calrissian flew the Millennium Falcon into the
            Death Star with Wedge Antilles, Norra Wexley, Keir Santage, Jake Farrell, and another A-wing pilot. They
            flew through the shafts and were pursued by several TIEs, which gunned down Keir's X-wing starfighter.
            Lando then ordered the group to split up, and Farrell, Wexley and the other A-wing pilot flew down
            another shaft to lure TIEs back out. Lando and Antilles then made it to the reactor core and destroyed
            the battle station's power plant before retreating back out as the Death Star began to detonate. During
            an attack on the Executor, Green Leader Arvel Crynyd's A-wing was crippled and crashed into the bridge,
            killing Admiral Firmus Piett and his staff. Having already taken considerable damage from the Alliance's
            starfighters, the Executor failed and drifted into the Death Star's gravity well, detonating on
            impact.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, aboard the station, a blow of an entirely different kind was struck against the Empire. A
            captive Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi in his own right, appealed to Vader's paternal love, convincing him
            to turn on his master. Vader—once again Anakin Skywalker—seized the Imperial head of state and hurled
            him down a shaft to his death, but at the cost of his own life. The Death Star itself soon exploded from
            the damages to its core. With the loss of both the Emperor and his right-hand man, Vader, the
            destruction of the Death Star, and significant losses inflicted on the Imperial fleet, the Imperials
            were forced to withdraw. The Empire had suffered a decisive defeat, leaving the Rebels to celebrate in
            victory.

            </figure>
            In the days following the Battle of Endor, news of the Emperor's death spread to several worlds across
            the galaxy including Tatooine, Naboo, Bespin, and Coruscant despite many attempts by the Empire to
            conceal the fact and declare this information to be false. While there was much celebration, a riot
            broke out at Coruscant's Monument Plaza. With the Empire in turmoil, the Rebel Alliance launched an
            assault on an Imperial outpost on the far side of Endor. This attack was led by General Solo and
            uncovered a lot of data and communications on Imperial plans.
            <br><br>
            The Rebel Alliance was eventually reorganized into the New Republic. The new government, however, still
            had to contend with Imperial holdouts. But luckily, the Emperor's contingency plan had the Empire thrown
            into chaos with Operation: Cinder turning them on their loyal planets.
            <br><br>
            One year after the destruction of the second Death Star, Republic and Imperial forces fought a major
            battle on the desert world of Jakku, which saw a Republic victory and the end of the Galactic Civil
            War. The Alliance also dispatched shock troopers to eliminate former Imperials that became warlords.
            The shock troopers were later assigned peacekeeping roles after the formation of the New Republic.
            <br><br>
            The symbol of the Alliance to Restore the Republic was used in the insignia of the New Republic and
            later became the emblem of the Resistance, a military force founded by Rebel veteran Leia Organa and
            made up of several Alliance officers, such as Gial Ackbar and Caluan Ematt, to combat the First Order,
            the successor of the fallen Empire. During the Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony in 28
            ABY, speeches were delivered by Senators Tai-Lin Garr and Leia Organa that reminded the gathered
            audience of the sacrifices made by the Rebel Alliance, which were further reinforced by an air show
            performed by Republic X-wings.
