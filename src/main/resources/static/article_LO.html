    <p>
        <b>Leia Skywalker Organa Solo</b> was a Force-sensitive human Alderaanian female political and military
        leader who
        served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Imperial Era and the New Republic and Resistance
        in the subsequent New Republic Era. Shortly after birth, she was adopted into the House of Organa—the
        Alderaanian royal family—and was raised as Princess <b>Leia Organa</b> of Alderaan, a planet in the Core
        Worlds
        known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of Senator Bail Prestor Organa
        and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, making her the heir to the Alderaanian monarchy. Instilled with the values
        of her adopted homeworld, Organa devoted her life to the restoration of democracy by opposing authoritarian
        regimes, such as the Galactic Empire and the First Order.
    </p>

    <p>
        Born in 19 BBY as <b>Leia Amidala Skywalker</b>, she was the daughter of the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker
        and
        Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, which saw the Jedi
        Order purged and the Galactic Republic reorganized into the Galactic Empire. With her mother's death in
        childbirth and her father's fall to the dark side of the Force, Leia and her twin brother, Luke, were
        separated to keep them hidden from the hands of the Emperor. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Leia
        Organa grew up peacefully—albeit secluded—on Alderaan until she was kidnapped by Vect Nokru—under the orders
        of the Third Sister, a member of the Inquisitorius—in 9 BBY. Since he had fought alongside her adoptive
        father in the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi went to Leia's rescue on Daiyu, and, after evading the
        Empire's hand on Mapuzo and Jabiim, Leia was brought back to Alderaan. Years later, Leia succeeded Bail by
        representing their homeworld in the Imperial Senate, though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the
        Galactic Civil War, however, Alderaan was destroyed along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the
        Empire's DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station, causing Organa to openly fight the New Order as a leader of
        the Rebel Alliance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Organa married the Corellian smuggler Han Solo and learned the Jedi
        arts as her brother's apprentice until giving birth to her son, Ben Solo, on the day of the Empire's
        capitulation in 5 ABY. Her personal and political life suffered in the years that followed, with Ben turning
        to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the Galactic Senate
        sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the military rank of general, she led the Resistance during the Cold
        War and sought to make amends with Ben. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in destroying the New
        Republic, and Organa's husband died at the hand of their estranged son in 34 ABY. Organa continued to lead
        the Resistance during the war against the First Order, all the while training Rey—a Force-sensitive
        scavenger from Jakku—as a Jedi.
    </p>

    <p>
        As her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the light
        side of the Force. Following her death on Ajan Kloss in 35 ABY, the Resistance defeated the forces of the
        reborn Darth Sidious's Sith Eternal on Exegol and inspired an uprising against the First Order across the
        galaxy. The heir to three inheritances, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey
        Skywalker, the military leader Poe Dameron of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only son, who ultimately
        returned to the light and sacrificed himself for Rey.

        <figcaption>Leia Amidala Skywalker was born after the fall of the Galactic Republic.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Leia Amidala Skywalker was born on the asteroid of Polis Massa two days after the end of the Clone Wars and the
    newly established Galactic Empire's purge of the Jedi Order. She and her twin brother, Luke, who was born
    shortly before her, were the children of Republic Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after the births, and
    Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. She was left with a
    lasting impression of images and feelings of her mother that her brother did not: that their mother was "very
    beautiful, kind, but sad." Though Leia was unsure if she had really seen her mother or if she had just
    invented the memories to fill the hole in her life.
    <br><br>
    Of the two Skywalker children, Yoda felt that Leia was more suited to be a Jedi, owing to her natural strength,
    will, and clarity (as opposed to her brother, who was impetuous, headstrong, unruly, and inattentive), wanting
    very much to train her. However, to protect the children from the Empire, Darth Sidious, who ruled the
    Empire as Galactic Emperor Palpatine, and the now–Sith Lord Darth Vader, Senator Bail Prestor Organa agreed to
    adopt the infant Leia together with his wife, Queen Breha of Alderaan, while Obi-Wan Kenobi personally watched
    over Luke, who would live with their father's stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru, on the planet
    Tatooine.

        <figcaption>During the Battle of Scarif, Organa acquired the Death Star plans through the sacrifice of Rogue
            One.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    During the Galactic Civil War, after the transference of the Alliance's headquarters from Dantooine to Yavin 4,
    and a battle for the technical readout of the Death Star, Organa volunteered for the mission to transport
    the plans, against the wishes of her father. He reluctantly allowed her to go but requested that she seek
    General Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine after intercepting the plans.

    <br><br>
    Originally Admiral Raddus was intended to escort Organa to Tatooine to meet with Kenobi. Raddus's ship, the
    Profundity, however, was diverted to Scarif once the fighting began. A squadron of Rebels calling
    themselves "Rogue One" managed to obtain the plans and beam them to Raddus' ship. The plans were copied onto a
    datacard by a squadron of Rebel soldiers still on the Profundity, which had been disabled by the Imperial-class
    Star Destroyer Devastator. Darth Vader led a boarding party onto the ship and massacred the entire squadron, but
    not before a fleet trooper handed the disc off to another man, Toshma Jefkin. He barely escaped Vader and got
    aboard the Tantive IV, which promptly detached from the Profundity and fled from the battle, setting a course
    for Tatooine with the plans for the superweapon. Vader, however, had spotted the Rebel ship and began tracking
    it to Tatooine, later issuing an arrest-on-sight decree for the capture of Organa.
    <br><br>
    Before jumping to lightspeed, Captain Antilles personally handed Senator Organa the datacard carrying the plans
    and asked her what they had been sent by the Rogue One squad; smiling, she replied with a simple enigmatic word:
    "hope." Minutes later, Leia learned from the ship's senior officers that the Tantive IV's impaired hyperdrive
    was causing it to leave a residual energy signature which could allow the Empire to track the ship. To make
    matters worse, she also learned that the ship's weapons and shields were barely functional because of the attack
    on the Profundity, whose feedback had affected the Tantive IV. The bosun then informed Leia that the Empire had
    issued a priority red directive to stop all ships matching the description of a CR-90 corvette.
    <br><br>

            One.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    The crew of the Tantive looked to the princess for guidance, believing that she would be able to lead them
    out of the tangled net they found themselves in. After a brief exchange with Jefkin, a man visibly shaken by
    what he had seen aboard the Profundity, Organa and Captain Antilles shared a grim realization that Darth Vader
    himself was after them as well. At a quarter of a parsec from their destination, the motivator on the ship
    finally gave out, forcing them to rely on sublight speed for the rest of the journey to Tatooine. Before they
    could reach the planet, however, their ship was hit by a Star Destroyer.
    </p>
    <h4 id="l2l2">Captured by the Empire</h4>
    <p>

        As Organa and her ship approached Tatooine, Captain Antilles ordered the crew to fire back at the Star
        Destroyer, but their efforts were of little use; the Devastator, the ship that had hunted them from
        Scarif, had caught them in a tractor beam right above the planet. As stormtroopers led by Darth Vader
        boarded the Tantive IV, Organa ran through the access hallways of the ship with the datacard in hand,
        desperate to find a way to deliver them to safety. Amid the shadowy corridors, she encountered R2-D2 and
        realized that the astromech could conceal the tapes.[
        <br><br>
    <figure>
        <img src="./IMG/leia/future_of_the_rebellion.jpg" alt="Luke & lightsaber" class="content_img">
        <figcaption>With no way to escape Vader, Organa sent R2-D2 to deliver the Death Star plans to Obi-Wan
            Kenobi.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Before she could instruct the droid of her plans, she was met by Antilles, who urgently requested that the
    senator flee in an escape pod. Organa, however, had other ideas and, after sharing a bittersweet goodbye with
    her old friend, ordered the captain to save as many members of the crew as he could. Alone with R2, she
    recorded a message for General Kenobi, begging him to return from exile to deliver the plans to her father on
    Alderaan. After finishing her message, the princess inserted the data card into the astromech and instructed him
    to take his own escape pod to Tatooine below. She then parted ways with R2 as his counterpart, the protocol
    droid C-3PO, approached. Watching the droids as they scampered away, Organa drew her blaster and prepared to
    find her own way off the captured vessel.
    <br><br>
    In another part of the ship, Antilles was captured and killed by Vader, who commanded his soldiers to hunt
    Organa down and bring her to him alive. Retreating further into the access hallways, the princess found
    herself cornered by a squad of stormtroopers led by TK-9091, who spotted the visage of Organa's pale white dress
    within the dark corridor. Hoping to buy time for R2 to escape, the senator blasted the trooper and attempted to
    run in the opposite direction, but she was rendered unconscious by a stun blast from TK-4601 and collapsed
    to the floor. While she lay on the ground, the trooper, whose birth name was Tarvyn Lareka, pondered how a
    beautiful individual like the princess could coldly kill his Imperial comrades. As Organa came to, she attempted
    to resist against the stormtroopers, but Lareka forced her into a pair of stun cuffs and threatened to blast her
    again. Before she was escorted to Vader, Lareka spontaneously removed his helmet and locked eyes with Organa,
    reminding her that the troopers she fought were flesh and blood. However, this act also reminded Lareka of this
    fact as well.

        <figcaption>Leia Organa stood defiant against Darth Vader, refusing to let the hidden plans fall back into
            the Empire's hands.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    The other soldiers shoved her back through the main corridors and past the lifeless bodies of the rebels who had
    died defending the princess, including Antilles. She was brought before Vader, who had witnessed the
    Tantive's escape from Scarif. Even still, Organa defiantly feigned ignorance of the Sith Lord's accusations,
    refusing to acknowledge that she had any part in the theft of the plans. Growing angry with the fiery senator,
    Vader ordered her to be taken aboard the Devastator and commanded his subordinate Daine Jir to inform the Senate
    that Organa and the other passengers had mysteriously died.
    <br><br>
    Once aboard the Star Destroyer, Leia managed to incapacitate her stormtrooper escorts and make her way to a
    hangar, hoping to take a shuttle and flee to Tatooine. Vader, however, had anticipated Organa's moves and met
    her in the landing bay. After stunning the princess by informing her that the Imperial Senate had been
    dissolved, the Sith Lord brought her to the ship's command bridge. As the Destroyer exited hyperspace, Organa
    was able to see the Death Star in person for the first time as Vader promised that she would be its first
    "guest." Organa's presence aboard the Death Star was kept a secret to all except for those who needed to
    know.

    The captive princess was transported to the Death Star and escorted to Detention Block AA-23. Her presence as a
    prisoner aboard the station was questioned by the officers who recognized her as an Imperial Senator, a
    designation that should have granted her diplomatic immunity. Nevertheless, Organa was locked away in Cell 2187,
    a small room that she unsuccessfully attempted to find an escape from. Although he technically had no proof that
    the princess was affiliated with the Rebel Alliance, Vader was more than certain of her deception and returned
    to her cell with an IT-O Interrogation Unit, an interrogator droid equipped with a powerful mind probe. Organa
    was submitted to the droid's truth serum, a drug that painfully altered her senses to coerce her into revealing
    the location of the Rebel base. Despite the persuasive hallucinations elicited by the serum, however, Leia
    resisted and refused to give up the information.

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    Following her interrogation, Organa's life was scheduled to be terminated by the man she had met years ago,
    Grand Moff Tarkin, though the governor had one more tool to make her talk: Alderaan. Within the overbridge of
    the Death Star, Tarkin gave Leia an ultimatum, threatening to use the station to destroy her homeworld unless
    she disclosed the base's location. Hoping to save both her people and her Alliance, the princess falsely
    confessed that the base was still on Dantooine. Both Tarkin and Vader believed her deception, though one of
    the Navy Troopers present on the bridge sensed that Organa was lying; this individual, however, chose not to
    speak up after sympathizing with the pain the princess had endured under the interrogator droid.
    <br><br>
    With the weapon already in position within the Alderaan system, Tarkin unveiled his own deception and fired upon
    the planet. Praying that the Death Star would somehow have a failure, Leia was forced by Vader to remain
    still and watch as her entire civilization was annihilated in one swift stroke, her father—whom she
    silently apologized to as the Death Star's ray hit Alderaan—and mother included. Bail and Breha died without
    knowing Leia was on the station above them, though they assured each other she was alive directly before
    the explosion reached their palace. Emotionally wrecked and utterly alone, the princess was taken back to
    her cell, where she was to await her imminent execution. Recalling her father's voice, Leia mustered what
    strength she could, her only hope of justice now resting within the memory banks of a droid on Tatooine.

    While Organa was detained by the Empire, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO had come under the possession of her twin
    brother, Luke Skywalker, on Tatooine. Equally as unaware of his parentage as Leia, Skywalker discovered his
    sister's message and delivered the astromech to Obi-Wan Kenobi, now going by the name of "Ben." The group hired
    the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca for passage to Alderaan aboard the Millennium Falcon but were stunned to
    learn that the planet had been blown away. During this discovery, the Falcon was captured by the Empire and
    taken aboard the Death Star, forcing the fugitives to infiltrate the base, split up, and plan an escape. Upon
    learning that the princess was held within the station, however, Skywalker convinced the party to lead a rescue
    mission for her.
    <br><br>
    Disguising themselves as stormtroopers and pretending to take Chewbacca as their prisoner, Skywalker and Solo
    marched into the Detention Level and freed Organa, who was underwhelmed by the duo's efforts until she learned
    that Kenobi had accompanied them. Cut off from the cell bay's exit by Imperial soldiers, Leia took matters into
    her own hands; grabbing hold of Skywalker's blaster rifle, she shot out the cover of a trash chute she had
    noticed when she was first brought aboard and led her would-be rescuers down into a garbage pit. After
    surviving an encounter with a dianoga and narrowly avoiding being crushed by the trash compactor, Organa came at
    odds with Captain Solo's rough nature and informed the trio that they would do as she told them in the future.
    The rebels were nearly able to regroup aboard the Falcon—a ship that failed to impress the princess—when Leia
    and Luke were separated from the group by stormtroopers during their escape.

    </figure>
    Pursued by Vader's troops, the twins found themselves at a dead end, coming to a stop over a chasm within the
    battle station. With stormtroopers firing upon them and no way to extend the bridge, Leia gave Luke a kiss on
    the cheek for luck as he used a grappling hook to swing themselves across the gap. The two met up again with
    Solo and Chewbacca and made their way to the Falcon. As the group boarded the freighter, Kenobi engaged Darth
    Vader in a lightsaber duel and gave his life to allow for the princess and the others to escape.

    The old Jedi's death devastated Luke, prompting Leia—who had herself experienced terrible loss— to comfort him
    as Solo piloted the ship away from the Death Star. After fending off the station's sentry fighters, the ship
    made the jump to hyperspace mostly undamaged. Organa correctly assumed that the Empire had planted a homing
    beacon on the vessel to discover the rebel base. Nevertheless, the group continued to Yavin 4, finally
    delivering the Death Star plans within R2 to the Alliance.
    </p>
    <h4 id="l2l5">Battle of Yavin</h4>
    <p>
        Arriving at the Yavin moon, Organa oversaw R2's transfer to General Vanden Willard at the Great Temple, the
        Alliance's base of operations. While Willard was quick to express his joy that the princess had escaped
        tragedy on Alderaan, Organa allowed no time for sorrow and quickly moved to have the data within the
        astromech droid analyzed. Utilizing the beacon attached to the Millennium Falcon, the Death Star entered the
        Yavin system and began preparations to fire on the moon. Rumors made their way through the Rebel flight
        crews that Organa had returned with vital intelligence on the station, but morale remained low; pilots like
        Dex Tiree felt that the Rebellion's meager troopers were greatly outmatched, even with the plans the
        princess had secured. Short on manpower, Organa commended Skywalker for his skills, prompting Willard to
        arrange a flight simulator test for the farm boy and allowing him to join the Alliance's Starfighter
        Corps.
        <br><br>
        After analyzing R2's schematics, the Alliance discovered a flaw in the Death Star's design deliberately
        created by the turncoat scientist Galen Erso. General Jan Dodonna briefed Organa and the rest of the
        Rebellion, explaining that a direct hit on one of the station's thermal exhaust ports would destroy the
        entire base. With this information, the rebel pilots prepared to attack the Death Star in X-wing
        starfighters, small snub-fighters that could evade the station's larger defenses. During the preparations,
        Organa arranged for Solo to be paid the reward he demanded for her rescue and allowed the smuggler to leave,
        despite Skywalker's protests. Organa remained in the Alliance's command center as Red, Gold, and Green
        Squadrons engaged the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin.

    Organa watched as the Alliance pilots were picked off one by one, obliterated by TIE fighters. Darth Vader
    himself would have destroyed Skywalker had it not been for Solo, who returned to aid the Rebellion aboard the
    Falcon and blasted Vader's fighter away from the battle. With no obstacles in his way, Skywalker successfully
    destroyed the Death Star just as it began its firing sequence, sending the personnel on Yavin 4 into
    celebration. In the moments after their victory, Alliance chief mechanic Nera Kase witnessed the princess mouth
    words up to the sky before rushing out to greet the returning pilots.

    After the surviving Rebel pilots returned from successfully turning the Empire's greatest weapon into nothing
    but a layer of dust orbiting Yavin, the personnel of the Yavin 4 base honored the heroes by orchestrating an
    award ceremony for them. As Organa waited for them to enter the hall, she felt entirely alone, even with
    other Alderaanians present that shared her loss of their world. With Alderaan destroyed and her parents with it,
    she would never become the queen her parents had prepared her to be. She was already prepared for a long war as
    ruling a planet and running a rebellion had much in common. She would not let her grief stop her, and she would
    celebrate their victory. When she saw the Heroes of the Rebellion enter the hall, she did not feel so alone.
    Organa, wearing an Alderaanian gown, handed out the medals to newcomers Skywalker and Solo.
    <br><br>
    The time for celebration would soon be over. Painfully aware of the loss of Alderaan, she asked the Rebels to
    take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when her homeworld was destroyed. It was
    brief, for Dodonna announced their need to evacuate Yavin 4 since the Empire now knew of their location. Organa
    then shared a moment of banter with Solo and a moment of rapport with Skywalker before they parted ways. Left
    alone, Organa noticed a lone female pilot paying respects to the memorial statue of her parents, Bail and
    Breha.

    <h3 id="l3">End of the Emperor's reign</h3>
    <h4 id="l3l1">A new base</h4>
    <p>
        Roughly three years after the Battle of Yavin,[source?] Organa helped oversee the construction of the
        Rebellion's recently established Echo Base on the ice planet of Hoth. When Kes Dameron and Shara Bey became
        trapped while carving out an ice tunnel for with an A-Wing laser cannon, Organa spoke to them after their
        rescue by Heroes of Yavin Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca, reaffirming their value as fellow Rebels.
        <br><br>
        With the hard working conditions and low temperatures weighing on Organa's mind, she made a speech to others
        at Echo Base about perseverance. Two days later, while on a tauntaun patrol with Han Solo and Hera Syndulla,
        Organa learned how to properly exercise control over the riding beast.
        <br><br>
        After Chewbacca went missing, Organa and R2-D2 searched for him in the corridors in which he was last seen.
        One of the doors appeared to have been severely damaged. Organa entered and found Chewbacca in the arms of a
        sleeping wampa. Organa woke the wampa accidentally. As Chewbacca and R2-D2 tried to repair the door, Leia
        distracted the wampa. She ran out into the corridor. The wampa followed, but with her little droid's help,
        the door closed in on the wampa cave.

    </figure>
    Following a run-in with one of Jabba's bounty hunters in Ord Mantell, Solo bade farewell to General Carlist
    Rieekan and Organa, but her lack of honesty about her feelings angered him. However, when no one could find
    Skywalker after his patrol, Solo set out on the Tauntaun Murra to find his friend during the night,
    worrying Organa. While they were missing, Rogue Two Zev Senesca—the squadron leader of Skywalker's Rogue
    Squadron during his absence—erased their current betting pool concerning how soon Organa would tire of Solo's
    attempts at impressing her, replacing it with a pool concerning which of them would find Skywalker first. Though
    several of the pilots wrote their names, Rogue Four Derek Klivian objected to the pool, feeling it was a morbid
    game over their commander's life. Before Senesca could respond, Organa revealed she was standing at the doorway
    by stating the pool was not morbid. She walked in and explained that, by betting in the pool, the pilots were
    certain Skywalker was alive. Taking the marker from Senesca, she bet on every pilot, explaining it was what she
    and the other Rebel leaders did every day. Certain that Rogue Squadron would find Skywalker and Solo, and as
    everyone watched her, she gave the marker back and bid the Force be with them. After she left, every remaining
    pilot added their name to the pool.
    <br><br>
    The following morning, Senesca located Skywalker and Solo, and Organa was relieved when they returned to the
    base. However, as an Imperial probe droid had alerted Vader and the Imperial fleet of their location, arriving
    soon on Hoth, Organa helped coordinate the ensuing evacuation, giving instructions to pilots, and signaled the
    ships to leave the planet. Once the base was overrun by Imperial ground forces, Organa and C-3PO were forced to
    escape Hoth aboard the Millennium Falcon with Solo and Chewbacca.

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    With a damaged hyperdrive, the Falcon was unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which
    prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to
    follow them, to repair the ship in the cave of an asteroid of great size. Using a fusioncutter, Organa helped in
    repairing the ship, when Solo appeared, drawing closer to her before both ended up in a passionate kiss that
    lasted until C-3PO's arrival. Organa withdrew and walked away, conflicted. Afterwards, Organa would reflect upon
    what happened in the cockpit when the ship was attacked by mynocks.
    <br><br>
    Rushing to shoo them away, Organa, Solo, and Chewbacca exited the ship, but Solo quickly realized that they were
    inside something other than a cave. Narrowly escaping the "cave," which was really the inside of an
    exogorth named Sy-O, who wanted them to stay as beloved parts of its internal ecosystem, and the
    asteroid Sy-O resided in, the Millennium Falcon was once again pursued by Imperial forces. Unable to make the
    jump to hyperspace due to unfinished repairs, Solo decided to land on the back of the command bridge of the
    Avenger, shutting down all systems to avoid detection. The plan worked; as the Imperial fleet prepared to exit
    the Anoat system, Solo detached the ship from the hull. With a faulty hyperdrive, the group decided to go to the
    Bespin system, where an old acquaintance of Solo, Lando Calrissian, owned a mining colony. However, they were
    unaware that they were being tracked by Boba Fett, one of the mercenaries hired by Vader to locate them.
    </p>


    <h4 id="l3l4">Escaping to Cloud City and Rendezvous Point Delta-Three</h4>
    <p>
    <figure>
        <img src="./IMG/leia/organa_on_cloud_city.jpg" alt="Leia on Cloud City" class="content_img"

        <figcaption>Leia on Cloud City<br>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    Arriving on Bespin, Organa and the others were greeted by Calrissian, whom Organa was immediately skeptical of.
    He agreed to repair the hyperdrive of the Millennium Falcon, and in the meantime, Organa and the others stayed
    at Cloud City. However, unbeknownst to them, Calrissian had made a deal with Vader to hand over the rebels in
    exchange for non-interference from the Empire. Captured by Vader, where the Dark Lord waited for Skywalker's
    arrival, Leia and the others were taken to a carbon-freezing facility, where Solo was to be frozen in carbonite
    to test if the chambers were suitable for trapping Skywalker. As the smuggler was lowered into the freezing pit,
    Organa's parting words were "I love you," to which Solo responded that he knew.
    <br><br>
    On their way to Vader's ship, Organa caught sight of a recently arrived Luke Skywalker and tried to warn him,
    but she, Chewbacca, and C-3PO were taken away by Imperial forces. Before long, Calrissian betrayed Vader by
    disarming the stormtroopers with the help of his men, setting the Rebels free. Though Chewbacca almost strangled
    Calrissian, Organa let him live when he told them of Solo's location at the East Platform. With R2-D2 joining
    them, they attempted to save the frozen Solo from being taken away by Fett, but they were too late—the bounty
    hunter had already left on the Slave I with Solo. All the while, Skywalker dueled Vader until he lost his right
    hand, lightsaber, and learned that the Dark Lord was his father.

    Jumping down a shaft, Skywalker eventually ended up hanging on a weather scanner vane below Cloud City and
    called Organa out of instinct. The princess, who was escaping aboard the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca,
    R2-D2, C-3PO, and Calrissian, sensed Skywalker's presence through the Force, and they turned around to retrieve
    Skywalker at her insistence. Once they rescued Skywalker, the ship was chased by TIE/ln starfighters into orbit
    and confronted by the Executor. Thanks to the astromech droid, the hyperdrive worked, and the Falcon escaped the
    Imperial threat. Aboard the Falcon, Organa was still angry at Calrissian for making his deal with the
    Empire and introduced him to Skywalker. She then comforted her friend, who chose not to tell her that Vader was
    his father, instead revealing to her that Obi-Wan Kenobi had not responded when he reached out. Organa was
    certain the Jedi Master would answer and that, if he did not, Skywalker was strong enough to find his own path.
    Knowing they could not save Solo but that they could help the rebellion, Organa ignored Calrissian's concerns
    about the Empire and chose to return to the Rebel fleet, commandeering the Falcon for the Alliance. She also
    reminded Calrissian that he had betrayed them to the Imperials, which was something she felt they would not move
    past for some time, though the Cloud City administrator felt he deserved credit for getting the team off Bespin.
    <br><br>
    They arrived in the Mid Rim to meet with the Fourth Division at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. There, they
    assisted in helping the Division's and Green Squadron's ships in escaping Commander Ellian Zahra's Hunter
    Fleet's blockade. Organa then all of Zahra's TIEs chase after the Falcon. Organa and Skywalker manned the
    turrets as Calrissian and Chewbacca flew the Falcon into an attack run. Organa, the Falcon, the 4th division
    were able to escape. Though her other forces had destroyed the Eighth Division, Zahra was forced to report her
    failure to Vader, who was aware of her hatred for Organa. Seeking to keep Skywalker alive, Vader allowed her to
    kill the Rebel princess if she could but informed her that the Falcon was off limits. Having escaped to Backup
    Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine, Organa then went to meet with Commander Grek aboard his ship. They discussed how
    the Empire found them and the Eighth Division at Malastare, and Organa realized that the Empire had broken their
    codes. Thus, the rebels knew if any cell contacted another, both groups could be found and destroyed. Organa and
    the others were unable to warn the other scattered rebels because of this, and Calrissian even feared they could
    be all that remained of the Rebel Alliance.
    <br><br>
    A short time afterward, Calrissian promised he would head to Tatooine to learn if Fett had delivered Solo to
    Jabba yet. If not, he intended to look for leads on the bounty hunter. Organa elected to stay behind to help the
    Rebel fleet, though she had Chewbacca go with their new ally to make sure he went to the desert world and then
    right back. Organa then spoke with Skywalker about getting a prosthetic hand, though the young Jedi was still
    questioning himself after learning Vader was his father. Organa, 3PO, and R2 accompanied Skywalker when he
    received the new hand and watched as Calrissian and Chewbacca left to find Solo aboard the Millennium
    Falcon. Organa then spoke to Commander Grek's crew, pilots, and the Pathfinders about the Empire's
    continuing hunt for the Alliance. She proposed to find and contact the other cells without using their codes.
    Organa agreed to use Grek's Operation Starlight.

    </figure>
    Following Calrissian, R2-D2, and C-3PO's infiltration at Jabba's Palace to rescue Solo, Organa arrived with
    Chewbacca as her "prisoner" to collect part of the bounty Jabba had put on Solo's head. Unknown to Organa,
    Fett had tipped off the crime lord, and as such, Jabba already knew that whoever was under Boushh's helmet
    wasn't him, but he was still willing to pay the impostor, who he believed was a short lowlife smuggler.
    Jabba offered 25,000 credits for Chewie, but Leia demanded 50,000 and no less. This angered Jabba, who knocked
    C-3PO to the ground. When Jabba asked her why he needed to pay 50,000, Leia took out a thermal detonator and
    threatened the crime lord, alarming his guests. Jabba laughed and offered 35,000 for the Wookiee, an offer
    Organa accepted, and Chewie was taken by two Gamorrean guards to be imprisoned.
    <br><br>
    Later that night, Organa released Solo from his carbonite coffin. After revealing her identity, the two kissed.
    However, they were immediately caught by Jabba and his minions, prompting Organa to use her armor to signal
    Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured. Solo was sent to the dungeons and placed in the same
    cell as Chewbacca, while Organa was brought before Jabba. Despite Organa's attempt to threaten the Hutt, he
    replied sarcastically and licked her face. Jabba then enslaved her and forced her to wear a dancing-girl
    costume. Having been chained to Jabba's throne, Organa was kept beside the gangster and displayed as a trophy in
    his court.

    </figure>
    After a late-night party, Jabba and Organa were sleeping on the throne when Skywalker arrived at the
    palace. They were awoken by Jabba's majordomo, Bib Fortuna, who was mind-tricked into granting Skywalker's
    entry. Organa watched in silence as Skywalker tried to convince her new master to release his friends. Jabba
    refused to bargain with the Jedi and dropped him into a pit with a rancor. While Skywalker managed to kill the
    beast, Jabba was enraged and punished Organa by strangling her. Jabba declared that Skywalker, Solo, and
    Chewbacca were to be taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon and eaten alive by the sarlacc.
    <br><br>
    Though she was spared from execution, Organa was forced to accompany Jabba on his sail barge, the Khetanna,
    while her friends were transported on a smaller skiff. During the ride, she was allowed to leave her master's
    side momentarily to watch her friends from a window, but Jabba eventually forced her to return to him on his
    throne. Jabba then informed Organa that she would soon learn to appreciate him. The crime lord celebrated his
    plans by making Organa share a drink with him.
    <br><br>

    </figure>
    When they finally reached their destination, Organa patiently waited until Skywalker started attacking with his
    new lightsaber. She destroyed the barge's controls to throw the vessel into darkness and jumped over Jabba's
    tail. Grabbing the slack of the very chain with which Jabba had enslaved her, Organa threw its length around the
    crime lord's huge neck and forcefully strangled him to death. R2-D2 then broke her chain, and they headed for
    the top surface of the sail barge, where the astromech droid and C-3PO jumped off the vehicle's edge and Organa
    met with Skywalker. Pointing the deck cannon toward the heart of the vehicle, the two initiated the barge's
    destruction and swung to the skiff where Calrissian, Chewbacca, and Solo awaited them. Picking up the two
    droids, they drove the skiff off just as the Khetanna exploded.
    </p>

    <h4 id="l3l6">Battle of Endor</h4>
    <p>
        Organa later departed for Sullust with the rest of the crew (except for Skywalker and R2-D2) aboard the
        Millennium Falcon to reunite with the rest of the Rebel Alliance's fleet, assembling for its greatest
        operation yet—the assault on the second Death Star, located in the Endor system. During the briefing,
        she volunteered for Solo's ground assault to deactivate the deflector shield protecting the space station,
        as did Chewbacca and Skywalker (and his droids). Before the mission, Mothma tried to talk some sense
        into Organa on behalf of her deceased parents, even though she knew that Organa would refuse to listen to
        her advice.

    </figure>
    Aboard the Tydirium, the team landed on the moon, as willed by Vader, aware of his son's presence on the
    shuttle. Making their way through the forest, they came across Imperial scout troopers, whom Organa and
    Skywalker pursued on a stolen speeder bike. Though they took care of the troopers, the two were separated as she
    was thrown off her speeder and knocked unconscious. An Ewok, Wicket, woke her up, and Organa quickly befriended
    him. Though they were discovered by two other scouts, Organa and Wicket managed to get rid of them. While on
    their way to Wicket's home, Bright Tree Village, they came across two other Ewoks who had been stopped by two
    stormtroopers. Wicket climbed a nearby tree and, with help from Organa, trapped the stormtroopers in a vine.
    When Organa, Wicket, and the two other Ewoks arrived at Bright Tree Village, they presented her with a dress as
    a gift for helping them escape the stormtroopers.
    <br><br>
    After a few hours, she realized that her friends were to become a banquet in C-3PO's honor, whom the Ewoks
    thought to be their god. She tried to intervene, but they threatened her with spears. They were only freed after
    Skywalker used the Force to levitate the protocol droid as a proof of his deific "magic" to the tribe. Later
    that night, Organa listened as C-3PO told the Ewoks their story, prompting Chief Chirpa to proclaim them a part
    of the tribe.

    It was then that Skywalker decided the time had come for him to leave his friends and face Vader, and Organa
    followed him out of the tribal gathering and asked him what was troubling him. Skywalker then revealed that not
    only was Vader his father but hers as well, and that he was her brother, something she had somehow always known;
    he then left the village to face the Sith Lord in combat alone. Solo then appeared to question Organa, and
    became jealous of Skywalker, but soon apologized and comforted her.
    <br><br>
    The next day, Organa fought alongside the rest of the team in the battle that followed their initial
    infiltration at the shield generator and subsequent capture by Imperial reinforcements. While the Ewoks provided
    a distraction long enough for them to take hold of their position at the doors, she was injured with a blaster
    wound and Solo confessed his love when she protected him from two stormtroopers. With Chewbacca's stolen All
    Terrain Scout Transport, they tricked the officers into letting them enter and destroy the shield generator,
    which in turn allowed Calrissian and Nunb, along with Antilles, to fly into the Death Star's core and destroy it
    from the inside.
    <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2 id="anchor2">Personality and traits</h2>
    <p>
        Of commanding presence and remarkable leadership, adult Organa was a brave and sharp-witted diplomat who was
        unafraid to speak her mind, even when confronted by powerful figures like Darth Vader and Grand Moff
        Tarkin. Organa was also able to keep her composure even in humiliating situations to perform daring
        feats, like diving into a garbage chute or strangling the infamous Jabba the Hutt. However, she was
        also capable of quieter acts. Growing up in the early days of the rebellion, she became skilled at keeping
        secrets, a trait beneficial to the greater good but detrimental to those around her. Her close friend
        Raymus Antilles recognized her as an ever-enigmatic individual, never revealing more than was necessary to
        her allies to ensure their protection.
        <br><br>
        Smart, fierce, and headstrong, Organa would accomplish whatever task she imposed on herself, for she would
        put duty before her personal needs—likely because of her upbringing. She only "gave as good as she
        got," which was one of the reasons Han Solo had taken a liking to her. In spite of her self-discipline,
        Organa had a fiery temper she often struggled to control and was eager to prove herself, to be recognized
        for what she could do instead of for her title of nobility. Certain individuals of the Rebel Alliance
        gossiped about Organa's perceived coldness, with some even describing her as an "ice princess."

    <h2 id="anchor3">Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        Leia actively demonstrated the ability to sense her brother's presence through the Force. When Luke failed
        to contact Kenobi while hanging underneath Bespin's Cloud City, weak and helpless, he called out to Leia
        with the Force, apparently out of instinct. She sensed him, and thus asked to direct the Millennium Falcon
        to his location. After the second Death Star blew up, she assured Solo that Skywalker had not been on
        it at the time.

        Leia wields a Defender sporting blaster pistol, which was called "Satine's Lament", which she used to defend
        herself from Imperial stormtroopers, used it again during the Battle of Theed, and to stun Poe Dameron
        aboard the Raddus.
