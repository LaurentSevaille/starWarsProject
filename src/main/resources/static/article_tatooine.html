            <p>
                <b>Tatooine</b> was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim
                Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited two scorching suns, resulting in the world
                lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the
                planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface
                vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species and of Anakin and Luke
                Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.
            </p>

            <p>
                It saw a population explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet's silicate
                surface. Finding the ore to have undesirable metallurgical properties, mining firms left the planet en
                masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large sandcrawlers, which were later used by the
                Jawa population. The planet then became a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, and fell under the
                influence of the Hutt Clan while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants endured.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generally ignored by the galaxy at large, Tatooine gained the notice of the Galactic Empire during the
                Galactic Civil War when an escape pod carrying two droids in possession of top-secret information landed
                on the sandy Outer Rim world. The Empire went on to establish a heavier presence on the planet, forging
                a tenuous relationship with Jabba Desilijic Tiure of the Hutt Clan. Open conflict soon broke out between
                the Empire and a Rebel Alliance cell on Tatooine that culminated in a battle that left the Empire's hold
                on the world significantly weakened.
            </p>

            <p>
                Following the death of Jabba and the withdrawal of Imperial forces after the Battle of Endor, an
                enormous power vacuum occurred on the world, with numerous crime syndicates like the Red Key Raiders
                attempting to build legitimacy as mining companies. Eventually, former bounty hunter Boba Fett returned
                and took over Jabba's former territory. Coming into conflict with both the Hutt Clan and the Pyke
                Syndicate, the new Daimyo was pulled into a gang war that threatened the future of Tatooine. With help
                from the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Fett rallied the denziens of the settlements Mos Espa and Freetown to
                push back against the invaders, ushering in a new era of respect between the people of the planet.

            Tatooine was a planet located in the Outer Rim, a region of the galaxy far removed from its core. It had
            three moons, Ghomrassen, Guermessa, and Chenini. Long ago, Tatooine was covered in oceans and rainforests,
            but for unknown reasons, it became a hot desert world. Tatooine orbited twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II. The
            whole planet was covered in harsh deserts, and only a small part of its northern hemisphere could sustain
            intelligent life. The landscape was covered with sand dunes, mountains, and canyons, which made traversing
            the planet very difficult. Due to the absence of surface water, those who lived on Tatooine had to draw
            moisture through the dry air.
            <br><br>
            Rain was incredibly rare on Tatooine, coming once a year, decade, or century. When the rain came, some
            plants were able to grow in a brief yet glorious period. Inhabiting the planet were many native species,
            the largest of which were the carnivorous krayt dragons. The common krayt dragon, while more plentiful, was
            shadowed by the greater krayt dragon, which submerged itself under the shifting sands and used its powerful
            limbs to traverse through the dunes. In addition, the common bantha and eopie species also found a home on
            the world, along with dewbacks, rontos, womp rats, massiffs, and scurriers.
            <br><br>
            The cities of Tatooine were frequently blasted by sandstorms and the inhabitants always seemed to know when
            one was coming. Not much distinguished the towns as the poor standard of living was common. The cities were
            separated from each other by large expanses of deserts. Rural life, on the other hand, was mostly small
            moisture farms that sold water and food for a meager living.
            </p>

            <h2 id="anchor2">Culture</h2>
            <p>
                An annual holiday celebrated on the planet was Boonta Eve. The holiday was celebrated in honor of Boonta
                Hestilic Shad'ruu, a Hutt who rose to be a god. The economy of Tatooine largely ran on water and
                crime. With the Hutt Clan taking near-full control over the trafficking and smuggling trades, new
                citizens had a large time breaking into the criminal market even though it was more lucrative than the
                water market.

            </figure>
            It was homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species—and presumably with vast oceans of surface
            water, lush rainforest and flowered fields. According to the Legend of Lehon, Tatooine had also
            been inhabited by a group called the Kumumgah during this time, but there was little evidence to support
            the story. Sometime in Tatooine's history, the whole planet became a desert by unknown means when
            the oceans dried away. Much later, it would be colonized by early settlers and explorers, who
            mistook the planet for a third sun owing to its highly reflective silicate surface.
            <br><br>
            As a result of sporadic and unsuccessful colonization ventures, the planet became a haven for smugglers and
            criminal activity, while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants attempted to earn a
            living in the wastes.
            <br><br>
            A long-ago mining boom saw the widespread use of sandcrawlers on the desert plains in an effort to mine
            valuable minerals. However, after it was discovered that most valuable minerals could be found on the
            surface, along with most minerals having unwanted metallurgic properties, the sandcrawlers were
            abandoned and eventually picked up by the native Jawas for use as shelter and mobile bases, from which they
            collected scrap from thousands of years of crashed spacecraft and failed mining projects.
            <br><br>
            Offworlders erected various cities in the desert, and colonists who decided to stay on the planet built
            moisture farms. The B'omarr Order on Tatooine kept their disembodied brains floating in jars that hung below
            their spider-like droid bodies, and built a monastery on the planet which would eventually come under the
            ownership of Jabba Desilijic Tiure as his palace.
            <br><br>
            Most wealth eventually found its way into the city of Mos Espa, with most of it procured from gambling and
            off-world trade, especially through the lucrative black market. The influx of commercial ventures fueled Mos
            Espa's growth, eventually securing its regional importance as a hub of economic and financial activity. With
            high tariffs imposed by the Hutts, some believed themselves able to escape paying them by doing business in
            the planet's de facto capital, however often found themselves scammed and broke if not through gambling,
            through simple bad luck.

                In the last decades of the Galactic Republic, Tatooine was known as a haven for smugglers and criminal
                activity, and also as the home to a human slave named Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin.
                <br><br>
                During this period, Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo escaped the capture of her homeworld by the Trade
                Federation, and she took refuge on Tatooine with her companions and protectors, including the Jedi
                Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Skywalkers befriended Amidala's party, and
                the young slave ended up participating in a podrace to help his new friends obtain a new T-14 hyperdrive
                generator for their damaged starship. After discovering that Anakin Skywalker would make an exceptional
                recruit for the Jedi Order, Master Qui-Gon Jinn managed to obtain his freedom from the junk dealer Watto
                in the city of Mos Espa, and the Queen's party left Tatooine with the boy. After participating in
                numerous adventures, including the Invasion of Naboo, the former Tatooinian slave joined the Jedi Order
                under Kenobi's tutelage.
                <br><br>
                Ten years later, Skywalker, now a gifted but unruly Jedi student, sensed that his mother, who had stayed
                on Tatooine and gotten married, was in terrible pain. Skywalker returned to the desert world in the
                company of Amidala, who was now a senator of the Republic and the young Jedi's secret lover. It
                transpired that Shmi Skywalker had been captured by Tusken Raiders and was detained in one of their
                camps. When Skywalker finally discovered his mother's location, he arrived too late, and she died in his
                arms from the consequences of the Tuskens' mistreatment of her. Enraged, the young Jedi slaughtered the
                entire Tusken tribe. This had serious consequences as the first step towards Anakin Skywalker's fall
                from grace. Shortly after the incident, the Clone Wars broke out, and the tortured Tatooinian Jedi
                became a major player of the pan-galactic conflict.
                <br><br>
                During the Clone Wars, a Jedi-backed mission to Jabba's Palace occurred, with the Jedi hoping to rescue
                Rotta the Huttlet from the Separatist Alliance. Later during the war, Chairman Papanoida and his
                son, Ion Papanoida headed to Tatooine to track down the bounty hunter Greedo, who had kidnapped members
                of their family.
                <br><br>
                Three years after the start of the war, Skywalker fell to the dark side and joined the Sith, old
                adversaries of the Jedi who had long planned to take over the galaxy. The Galactic Empire, a new regime
                established to replace the Republic, started to hunt all Jedi. Skywalker's former master Obi-Wan Kenobi
                went into hiding on Tatooine, bringing the infant son of the fallen Jedi with him. On the desert
                expanses of Tatooine, Kenobi hoped that he could keep young Luke from his father's evil influence.
                Kenobi entrusted the boy to Shmi's stepson, Owen Lars, and his wife Beru.

            <p>
                Shortly after the Battle of Scarif in the Galactic Civil War, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO landed on
                Tatooine's surface in an escape pod after their CR90 corvette the Tantive IV was captured by the
                Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. With the droids carrying the technical readouts to the
                battle station, a task force was sent to the planet in order to capture the two droids. Upon coming in
                contact with a Jawa sandcrawler, the two were abducted and later sold to Owen Lars of the Lars moisture
                farm, with R2 being chosen after another astromech droid, R5-D4 broke down. Later that day, Luke
                Skywalker, unknowingly Anakin Skywalker's son came across a recorded message of Princess Leia pleading
                for the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi against the Galactic Empire. Intrigued, if only because R2 later ran
                away, forcing Luke and C-3PO to retrieve him, the two were attacked by native Tusken Raiders. Being
                saved by Kenobi, Skywalker learned that he was a Jedi while Kenobi offered to train him. Refusing and
                heading home, Skywalker came across the remains of the sandcrawler that originally sold the two droids
                to his family. Realizing that it was the work of Imperial forces and that they may have traced the
                droids back to his house, he rushed back only to find the moisture farm burned to the ground, with the
                charred remains of his aunt and uncle laying outside in the sun. Agreeing to go with Kenobi to Mos
                Eisley, they discovered the city under Imperial control and they hired the services of smuggler Han Solo
                and his partner, Chewbacca to transport them offworld to Alderaan. Barely escaping an intense firefight
                with multiple sandtroopers, the two escaped Tatooine and several Star Destroyers into hyperspace.
                <br><br>
                Sometime during the Galactic Civil War, Tusken Raiders under the leadership of the Jundland General
                attacked local settlements. He and his followers were ultimately defeated by a gang of mercenaries
                located on-world. Having allied with the Rebel Alliance, the gang led the Rebels into a series
                of successful operations on Tatooine that would conclude with the defeat of the Empire's 68th Legion and
                Tatooine garrison. Nevertheless, the Empire would come to reestablish its presence on the desert
                world, with Lieutenant Ardo Banch serving as an officer in the garrison.
                <br><br>
                Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, a shuttle with emissaries in the employ of Jabba, who were meant to
                negotiate a deal to provide support to the Empire at Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1, was intercepted
                by the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and a strike team consisting of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and
                Leia Organa proceeded to the factory, infiltrating and destroying it. The negotiations having failed,
                Darth Vader returned to Tatooine to negotiate the deal with Jabba in person. After the negotiations were
                complete, Vader remained on Tatooine shortly to wipe out a Tusken Raider tribe and hire the bounty
                hunters Boba Fett and Krrsantan to ascertain the identity of the pilot who destroyed the First Death
                Star. Fett tracked down and dueled Skywalker, who had returned to the late Ben Kenobi's dwelling for
                education, learning his name and reporting to Vader.

                After learning he had a son, Vader traveled to Tatooine with his crew, consisting of Doctor Chelli Lona
                Aphra, 0-0-0, and BT-1, to investigate the Lars Homestead and Kenobi's home. When the Rebel Alliance
                split its forces up to escape the Empire after its major losses in the Battle of Hoth, the young
                human Vulaada Klam and her pet qaberworm Gurtyl found themselves on Tatooine after their time with
                the Rebellion on Hoth. Vader also returned to Tatooine in the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth and
                the duel on Cloud City to investigate the Lars Homestead once more.

                Following the battle over Jekara, Fett delivered Solo, now frozen in carbonite, to Jabba, where he
                served as a wall decoration. When Aphra was taken over by the Spark Eternal, her allies Sana Starros
                and Kho Phon Farrus traveled throughout the galaxy to collect those who cared about Aphra to save her.
                They traveled to Tatooine to recruit Klam, who was sitting atop Gurtyl in a town among several other
                residents, though Klam ultimately did not accompany them when they traveled to a Rebel Rendezvous to
                recruit Magna Tolvan.

                Attempting to rescue Solo, the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO infiltrated Jabba's Palace disguised as servants
                after Luke Skywalker "gifted" them to the crime lord. Arriving at the palace not long after, Skywalker
                attempted to bargain with Jabba for his friend's life, only to be refused and dropped into a rancor pit.
                After a struggle, Luke managed to kill the rancor, angering Jabba and sentencing him and Solo (who was
                freed by Organa in the guise of a bounty hunter who had captured his friend, Chewbacca) to death in the
                Great Pit of Carkoon, while Organa became one of Jabba's many entertainers. Later, as they were about to
                be executed, R2-D2 fired Skywalker's lightsaber at him from Jabba's sail barge, allowing Skywalker,
                Solo, and Lando Calrissian, who had been disguised as a guard, to make their escape. After an intense
                shootout, Organa strangled Jabba to death with the chain used to keep her hostage, and Boba Fett was
                knocked into the sarlacc. Skywalker, Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, Calrissian, and the two droids escaped the
                planet once more. Although Fett was swallowed by the sarlacc, he survived and managed to escape the
                creature's stomach, though his armor was stolen by Jawas shortly thereafter due to his weakness from his
                escape.

                Tatooine had only a few port cities, including Mos Espa and Mos Eisley. Beside those cities, which
                attracted many criminals, most settlers of Tatooine operated moisture farms in the expanse of the
                desert. Due to the planet's dangerously high daytime temperature and whipping sandstorms, most
                residents of Tatooine kept their skin covered with practical materials that wick away sweat and limit
                exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the twin suns.
                <br><br>
                Tusken Raiders often attacked isolated settlements on the fringes of their territory such as Anchorhead,
                and often took potshots at podracers during the Boonta Eve Classic, celebrated once every year as part
                of the Boonta Eve holiday celebrating the famed Hutt Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu and his ascension to
                godhood. The Max Rebo Band's song "Lapti Nek" ranked number two in the top five of Tatooine's greatest
                hits, beaten by Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes' number-one single "Mad About Me." The Modal Nodes
                followed up their success with the number-three hit "The Sequential Passage of Chronological Intervals"
                and ranked-five hit "Goodnight, But Not Goodbye (Mad About Me Remix)." The Max Rebo Band was left with
                only two of Tatooine's top five songs, with their number-four hit "(That Joyous Night) I Ate My
                Mate."

                Lawful inhabitants on the planet often utilized moisture vaporators owing to their energy efficiency,
                resulting in their status as one of the most crucial pieces of equipment for survival. While single
                vaporators often cost 500 credits each, some individuals bought and owned multiple units, creating
                moisture farms. Often utilizing the extra water for small hydroponic gardens, few gardens yielded enough
                to make substantial profits. In addition, vaporators required frequent maintenance and security systems
                to deter attacks from Tusken Raiders, who believed all water was sacred and belonged to them. The
                Raiders, native to the planet, were a nomadic tribal society with strict social and moral codes, along
                with defined territorial boundaries. Frequent colonial trespasses on their sovereign territory, along
                with the collusion between old values and galactic modernization, often forced the Tuskens to attack
                colonists whom they both vehemently feared and despised.
                <br><br>
                Jawas were also a native species to Tatooine, and as such deeply entrenched into a nomadic lifestyle.
                Unlike the Tuskens, whom they attempted to avoid, Jawas frequently sold collected scrap metal and droids
                to the scattered settlers on the planet, earning a reputation as merchants and vagabonds. Myth and
                folklore also played an important part in Jawa society, with the Jawa's belief that the great Dune Sea
                was once a true ocean. Later research into ancient fossil-bearing rock and eroded canyons seemed to
                support this notion. Nonetheless, most of Tatooine's inhabitants refused to believe the story, finding
                it far-fetched and ludicrous.
                <br><br>
                Slavery, while banned through Republic laws, was readily and blatantly practiced under the twin suns. An
                entire section of Mos Espa was purposed as a Slave Quarter. On Tatooine, at least, the institution of
                slavery was seen as a socioeconomic symbol of wealth and prestige, resulting in highly protective owners
                who reluctantly parted with their possessions. Used as capital in business transactions, nearly all
                slavery operations were overseen by the Hutt gangsters, who regarded slavery as a useful institution.
