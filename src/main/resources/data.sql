Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and\r\n        General Han Solo, Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore the\r\n        Republic—an\r\n        organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy.\r\n        Following\r\n        the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic\r\n        history.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with\r\n        his\r\n        twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala\'s death and Anakin\'s fall to the dark side of the\r\n        Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family\r\n        of\r\n        Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and\r\n        purpose,\r\n        Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi\r\n        Master\r\n        Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke\'s own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY,\r\n        Skywalker\r\n        saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire\'s planet-killing superweapon, the Death\r\n        Star.\r\n        He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father\r\n        before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master\'s death, Skywalker\r\n        participated in\r\n        the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was\r\n        in\r\n        fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke\'s help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by\r\n        killing Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen\r\n        One. Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker trained his sister as a first Jedi apprentice on Ajan\r\n        Kloss,\r\n        but Leia ended her training after the birth of her son and seeing his death as a result of finishing her\r\n        knighthood.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        With the Sith\'s destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker\r\n        traveled\r\n        across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. In 9 ABY,\r\n        Skywalker temporarily took on Grogu, a Force-sensitive child that belonged to the same species as Yoda,\r\n        as\r\n        an apprentice. However, during Grogu\'s training, Skywalker sensed that the child\'s heart wasn\'t into\r\n        relearning the Jedi path. After Grogu\'s friend, the Mandalorian Din Djarin visited the planet bearing a\r\n        gift\r\n        of chain mail armor for Grogu, Skywalker offered him with a choice: accepting the gift and returning to\r\n        the\r\n        Mandalorian, or taking Yoda\'s lightsaber and continue with his Jedi training. Grogu chose to return to\r\n        Djarin.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker later took his sister\'s son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline\'s raw strength\r\n        and\r\n        potential for limitless power, as an apprentice. As Master and Padawan, Skywalker traveled with his\r\n        nephew\r\n        and battled the Knights of Ren, studied lost Jedi lore, and gathered others to expand their new order\'s\r\n        ranks. In 28 ABY, Skywalker, glimpsing the darkness in his nephew, briefly contemplated killing him,\r\n        causing\r\n        Solo to fall to the dark side like Vader before him and destroy his nascent order. The loss of his\r\n        nephew\r\n        haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. The destruction of his temple and the deaths of all his\r\n        students\r\n        convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world\r\n        of\r\n        Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy\'s pleas for help\r\n        during the rise of the First Order.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain\r\n        of\r\n        events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness.\r\n        Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a\r\n        spark of\r\n        hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would\r\n        not\r\n        die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"navigation\">\r\n        <span><a id=\"title_menu\">Contents</a>\r\n            <button id=\"button_title\" onclick=\"myFunction()\" class=\"btn btn-link\" type=\"button\"> Show </button>\r\n        </span>\r\n        <ul class=\"nav flex-column justify-content-left\" id=\"menu\" style=\"display: none;\">\r\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n                <a class=\"nav-link dropdown-item\" href=\"#anchor1\">Biography</a>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li> <a href=\"#l1\">Early life</a></li>\r\n                    <li> <a href=\"#l2\">Joining the Rebellion</a></li>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l2l1\">Leaving Tattooine</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l2l2\">Jedi training</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l2l3\">Death Star rescue</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l2l4\">Battle of Yavin</a></li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#l3\">Traveling to Dagobah</a></li>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#l4\">Vader\'s revelation</a></li>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l4l1\">Haunted by the truth</a></li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#l5\">The last of the Jedi</a></li>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l5l1\">Solo Rescue</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l5l2\">Keeping the promise</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l5l3\">Adventure on the moon</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l5l4\">The final duel</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"#l5l5\">Anakin redemption</a></li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n                <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#anchor2\">Personality and traits</a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n                <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#anchor3\">Powers and abilities</a>\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#a3l1\">Lightsaber abilities</a></li>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#a3l2\">Force powers</a></li>\r\n                    <li><a href=\"#a3l3\">Other abilities</a></li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <h2 id=\"anchor1\">Biography</h2>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"l1\">Early life</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_baby-Luke.jpg\" alt=\"baby luke\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Luke as a baby\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker was sent away to live with his relatives on Tatooine.</figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    Luke Skywalker was born in 19 BBY on the asteroid field of Polis Massa two days after the proclamation\r\n    of the Galactic Empire. He and his twin sister, Leia, who was born minutes after him, are the children\r\n    of Galactic Republic\r\n    Senator Padmé Amidala, who died shortly after the births, and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who had\r\n    recently fallen to the dark side of the Force. To protect the children from the Empire and their father,\r\n    the now-Sith Lord Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi personally sent the infant Luke to be raised by Anakin\'s\r\n    stepbrother, Owen Lars and his wife, Beru on the planet Tatooine, while Senator Bail Organa agreed to\r\n    adopt Leia together with his wife, the queen of Alderaan.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Luke Skywalker spent his youth on the Lars\' moisture farm, where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to\r\n    discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been \"a navigator on a spice\r\n    freighter\" during the Clone Wars. His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle\r\n    had business in Mos Eisley, she took Skywalker to Anchorhead to use the HoloNet connections there and\r\n    show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    By the age of three in 16 BBY, Skywalker had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built\r\n    especially for him. He did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving\r\n    several of them at his grandmother, Shmi\'s sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as\r\n    Skywalker played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been\r\n    watching him from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the\r\n    realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by\r\n    one of the gang, Skywalker threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the\r\n    Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further,\r\n    slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included Owen Lars, who managed to gun down several\r\n    of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a Devaronian,\r\n    had snuck up behind Lars, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last\r\n    marauder in half. As Skywalker cheered, Lars threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Lars then\r\n    ushered Skywalker back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that\r\n    Skywalker\'s brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy\'s future.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Eventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father\'s natural piloting\r\n    skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine. At one point in his boyhood, Skywalker was\r\n    climbing in a canyon, but, when he grabbed the top, the rock broke off. Skywalker fell into a cave,\r\n    where he was seen by a group of womp rats and a krayt dragon, although he managed to escape the\r\n    creatures. Years later, C-3PO referenced this story to several visitors. When Skywalker was 12 years\r\n    old in 7 BBY, he and his friend, Windy went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and\r\n    wandered away from the moisture farms riding a dewback. The two encountered a sandstorm during their\r\n    time outside and both lost consciousness. A krayt dragon was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they\r\n    were saved by Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to the Lars family. Skywalker\r\n    asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father.\r\n    Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"l2\">Joining the Rebellion</h3>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l2l1\">Leaving Tattooine</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In 0 BBY, Skywalker was working on the family farm by repairing moisture vaporators with one of their\r\n        WED Treadwell repair droid when he spotted a battle over Tatooine; unknown to the young man, it was the\r\n        Rebel starship Tantive IV being chased by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator. Heading to\r\n        Tosche Station, Skywalker swapped stories with his friends, among them a visiting and recently-graduated\r\n        Darklighter, who was reluctant to believe Skywalker\'s claims about a battle upon looking up with\r\n        Skywalker\'s macrobinoculars and merely seeing the two craft sitting still in space. Nonetheless,\r\n        Skywalker was then eager to tell his friend of his recent exploits aboard his skyhopper in Beggar\'s\r\n        Canyon, which Darklighter was amused by. After warning his friend not to crash the ship, he leaned close\r\n        to Skywalker to tell his old friend a great secret: he intended to defect from the Empire to join the\r\n        Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps.\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_tattooine_lars_homestead.jpg\" alt=\"Lars\' Homestead\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Lars\' Homestead\">\r\n        <figcaption>Lars\' Homestead on Tattooine</figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Promising to keep an eye out for him, Darklighter and Skywalker then parted ways once again with the\r\n    hope that they could reunite one day. A short time later, the purchase of two droids—R2-D2 and\r\n    C-3PO—by Skywalker\'s step-uncle changed the young farm boy\'s life forever. Obtaining the droids from a\r\n    band of Jawas to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the\r\n    droids had narrowly escaped from the battle Skywalker had glimpsed, and that R2-D2 contained a\r\n    set of plans for the Empire\'s dreaded Death Star superweapon. While cleaning the two new droids back at\r\n    the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part\r\n    of a desperate message from Princess Leia Organa requesting help from someone named \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\"\r\n    whom R2-D2 claimed that he once belonged to.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Chasing after R2-D2 when the droid ran off to find Kenobi, Skywalker soon found himself in the company\r\n    of Kenobi after being attacked by a group of Sand People out in the Jundland Wastes. After traveling\r\n    back to the Jedi\'s home, Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a Jedi Knight who\r\n    served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker\'s father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not\r\n    a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Darth\r\n    Vader. Skywalker was also given his father\'s lightsaber by Kenobi, allowing the blade to be ignited for\r\n    the first time in years. After he showed Princess Leia\'s message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old\r\n    Jedi Master requested Skywalker\'s help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of\r\n    the Force. Skywalker initially refused to get involved, as he believed his duties at home were more\r\n    important, but he offered to take Kenobi to Anchorhead.\r\n    <br> <br>\r\n    On their way to Anchorhead, Skywalker and Kenobi came upon a group of slaughtered Jawas—the same ones\r\n    who sold the droids to his uncle. Skywalker deduced from learning that Imperial stormtroopers were\r\n    responsible that they might have looked into the sales records of the droids, and rushed home in the\r\n    hopes of saving his step-aunt and step-uncle. Upon returning home, Skywalker discovered that he was too\r\n    late: his step-aunt and step-uncle had been murdered by the Empire. With the people who raised him dead,\r\n    he decided to accompany Kenobi to Alderaan to deliver the plans back to the Alliance and learn the ways\r\n    of the Jedi.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l2l2\">Jedi training</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_lightsaber.jpg\" alt=\"Luke & lightsaber\" class=\"content_img\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker learned through Kenobi that his father<br>\r\n            was once a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and <br>\r\n            his path to be a Jedi under Kenobi.</figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    On their way to Mos Eisley, Kenobi began training him and gave Skywalker his first lesson, during which\r\n    he learned the basics of Jedi meditation. They would later reach Chalmun\'s Spaceport Cantina, where\r\n    Kenobi believed that they could find a pilot that could get them to Alderaan. Inside the cantina,\r\n    Skywalker nearly had a fatal run-in with the criminals Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan, but trouble was\r\n    avoided when Kenobi sliced off Baba\'s arm with his lightsaber in defense of Skywalker.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    The two were eventually able to find a pilot that could take them to Alderaan in the form of Han Solo, a\r\n    Corellian smuggler, and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Solo\'s initial rate was ten thousand credits all paid in\r\n    advance, which Skywalker thought was too expensive. Ultimately, they were able to compromise when Kenobi\r\n    offered to pay two thousand credits up front and an additional fifteen thousand when they got to\r\n    Alderaan, for a total of seventeen thousand credits, which convinced Solo to take them, with Skywalker\r\n    selling his speeder to pay for the two thousand up front. As they left the cantina, they were also\r\n    cornered by a stormtrooper, but Kenobi took out the trooper with the Force by throwing large pieces of\r\n    metal. With it clear that stormtroopers were all around the city, the two moved to quickly depart Mos\r\n    Eisley.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    After escaping stormtroopers on Solo\'s ship, the Millennium Falcon, Kenobi began Skywalker\'s instruction\r\n    in the ways of the Force, using a training remote to instruct him in basic lightsaber combat, much to\r\n    the derision of Solo, who dismissed it as a \"hokey religion.\" Wearing a helmet that completely\r\n    covered his eyes for part of the lesson, Kenobi encouraged him to reach out with the Force to combat the\r\n    remote. Despite his vision being totally impaired, Skywalker was able to successfully deflect a pair of\r\n    blaster bolts from the remote, claiming that he could \"almost see\" the remote through the Force.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l2l3\">Death Star rescue</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <div class=\"quote\">\r\n        <dl>\r\n            <dd>\r\n                <i>\"Aren\'t you a little short for a stormtrooper?\"</i> <br>\r\n                <i>\"Huh?!\"</i>\r\n            </dd>\r\n            <dd>\r\n                - Princess Leia upon seeing Luke in his Stormtrooper disguise.\r\n            </dd>\r\n        </dl>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_stormtrooper_disguise.jpg\" alt=\"Luke stormtrooper\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Luke disguise as a stormtrooper\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker disguised as a stormtrooper <br> to rescue Princess Leia Organa.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    The lesson, however, was soon interrupted by their arrival in the Alderaan system and their discovery of\r\n    the planet\'s destruction. They then spotted a patrolling TIE fighter and, upon following it, found that\r\n    it was approaching what appeared to be a small moon, which turned out to be the Death Star. Caught by\r\n    the Death Star\'s tractor beam, they were brought aboard the massive space station.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Once on board, Luke and Han knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out\r\n    to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when R2-D2 discovered that Leia Organa was being held captive\r\n    on the station, Skywalker insisted on rescuing her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the\r\n    detention block, Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he\'d get a\r\n    significant reward for doing so.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Still using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Chewbacca to pose as a prisoner and\r\n    escorted him to Detention Block AA-23 (where Organa was being held.) They were able to rescue Organa,\r\n    but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the garbage compactor in order to escape the\r\n    pursuing Imperial forces. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Chewbacca, they were\r\n    able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Eventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with\r\n    Darth Vader. Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief. Despite the fact that\r\n    they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to\r\n    them, so at Solo\'s request, Skywalker manned one of the Millennium Falcon\'s quad laser cannons to\r\n    eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was\r\n    eliminated, they traveled to the hidden rebel base on Yavin 4, unaware that the Death Star was tracking\r\n    them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l2l4\">Battle of Yavin</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_pilot_with_rebellion.jpg\" alt=\"Luke with the Rebellion\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Luke as a pilot for the Alliance\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker joined the Rebel Alliance as a pilot.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    Upon their arrival at the Yavin base, they met with Commander Willard and Organa introduced him to\r\n    Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a pilot. Skywalker then separated and met Wedge\r\n    Antilles, who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 seconds, the more experienced\r\n    pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second\r\n    try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of\r\n    Antilles\'s, prompting Willard to accept him without objection. He joined Red Group with the\r\n    designation of Red Five, which had previously belonged to a cadet named Pedrin Gaul, who had\r\n    perished during the Battle of Scarif several days earlier.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    After the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself\r\n    for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the Falcon for rescuing Organa and prepared to\r\n    leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo\r\n    refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply\r\n    disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well, Skywalker was about to board his T-65B\r\n    X-wing starfighter, when he encountered his old friend Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as\r\n    wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Luke that the two would\r\n    catch up on each other\'s stories when they got back. Skywalker was also approached by Garven Dreis, the\r\n    commander of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter\r\n    vouched for his friend, calling him the \"best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.\" Skywalker was\r\n    assigned command of fourth flight for the battle.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    As the Battle of Yavin got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space,\r\n    Skywalker was guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He participated in Red Squadron\'s initial assault\r\n    on the Death Star\'s outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station\'s numerous turbolaser\r\n    batteries and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also\r\n    helped to provide cover for Gold Squadron when they made the first attack run on the meridian trench, as\r\n    well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Darth Vader himself joined the fray in\r\n    a TIE Advanced x1 and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by\r\n    the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with\r\n    Darklighter and Antilles.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Skywalker took charge of the last attempt on the thermal exhaust port as instructed, but Vader and his\r\n    two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter\r\n    suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen\r\n    friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who\r\n    urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter\'s targeting\r\n    computer, much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface\r\n    of Yavin 4.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_pilot_yavin.jpg\" alt=\"Luke at the Battle of Yavin\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Luke at the Battle of Yavin\">\r\n        <figcaption>After destroying the Death Star, <br> Skywalker became a fully committed soldier in the\r\n            Rebellion.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    Just as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like\r\n    he had the other pilots, but before he could, Han Solo and Chewbacca showed up in the Millennium Falcon,\r\n    destroying Vader\'s two escorts and causing Vader\'s TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the\r\n    trench. At Solo\'s urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two proton torpedos, using the Force to\r\n    guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he,\r\n    Chewbacca, and Han Solo were awarded the Medal of Bravery the next morning.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Just as the ceremony ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of\r\n    her family and homeworld. Afterwards, General Jan Dodonna sent him and Antilles, the only other survivor\r\n    of Red Group, in their X-wings to retrieve the wayward princess and bring her to the Great Temple. Her\r\n    shuttle\'s pilot, Evaan Verlaine, however, managed to outsmart them and make the jump to hyperspace with\r\n    course to Naboo, with R2-D2 accompanying the two women. They would later reunite after she had\r\n    successfully accomplished her mission. Soon after, Skywalker became an officer in the Alliance and\r\n    was given the rank of Lieutenant and was regularly assigned numerous independent missions.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"l3\">Traveling to Dagobah</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker then traveled to Dagobah, which turned out to be a remote swamp planet, where he encountered\r\n        Yoda, the former Grand Master of the fallen Jedi Order. In their initial meeting, Skywalker was\r\n        frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Yoda, who did not initially\r\n        identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker\'s patience, telling him a story about three\r\n        brothers, and taking him back to his hut to partake in a meal of rootleaf stew, which he did not\r\n        find very appetizing.\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_yoda-on-dagobah.jpg\" alt=\"Master Yoda\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Master Yoda on Dagobah\">\r\n        <figcaption>Traveling to Dagobah, Skywalker sought out <br> Grand Master Yoda in order to complete his\r\n            Jedi training.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    However, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Yoda\r\n    agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi\'s spirit. Skywalker\'s training proved to be\r\n    difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Skywalker\'s training on Dagobah lasted several weeks, with Kenobi needing to appear in Yoda\'s dreams\r\n    more than once to convince the old master to keep up Luke\'s training and argue that the boy would not\r\n    end up like this father. When Skywalker and Yoda argued, Kenobi also regularly appeared to stop their\r\n    arguments. One day during his training with Yoda, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use\r\n    his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Yoda\r\n    decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    When Yoda asked him to enter a cave that was strong in the dark side in which he was supposed to find\r\n    only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing the armor of Darth Vader,\r\n    meant to symbolize his inner darkness.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Shortly after, he had a vision of Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering at Cloud City on Bespin. Unable to\r\n    get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help\r\n    them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Yoda and Kenobi\'s\r\n    insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that\r\n    he\'d learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy\r\n    of the Empire.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Seeing that Skywalker\'s mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could\r\n    not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Yoda advised him to mind\r\n    what he\'d learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his\r\n    training.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"l4\">Vader\'s revelation</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Upon his arrival at Cloud City\'s East Platform, Skywalker felt Vader\'s presence, and went into the\r\n        nearest building, where he was shot at by Fett, who had come to claim a bounty put on Solo by Jabba the\r\n        Hutt, and tried to pursue a group of stormtroopers and Imperial officers who held Organa, Chewbacca, and\r\n        C-3PO captive. The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path\r\n        was diverted to the carbon-freezing chamber where Darth Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze\r\n        him in carbonite to present him to the Emperor. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce lightsaber\r\n        duel.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        During the duel, Vader praised Skywalker\'s training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into\r\n        giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to\r\n        knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but\r\n        Skywalker leapt out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City\'s gas-processing vanes. Vader\r\n        began using the Force to throw various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such\r\n        projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation\r\n        port. The chamber was quickly depressurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk\r\n        overlooking the reactor shaft. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk\'s railing and pull himself\r\n        up.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Vader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was\r\n        weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed as Obi-Wan Kenobi had\r\n        been. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with\r\n        several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off\r\n        his right hand. Both Skywalker\'s hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/i-am-your-father.jpeg\" alt=\"Darth Vader tells Luke he is his father\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Darth Vader tells Luke he is his father\">\r\n        <figcaption>Vader reveal he is is Skywalker father<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    Seeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of\r\n    the dark side and complete his training, but Skywalker adamantly refused to ever join Vader, the man who\r\n    had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that <i>he</i> was his father.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Horrified by Vader\'s shocking revelation, Skywalker initially denounced the Sith Lord\'s claim as untrue\r\n    and impossible, but Vader insisted that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader further claimed that\r\n    Skywalker was powerful enough to destroy the Emperor, and when he did, they could rule the galaxy\r\n    together as father and son. Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took\r\n    the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through\r\n    several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to\r\n    grab onto a weather vane to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever,\r\n    especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in\r\n    desperation, he called out to Leia Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Soon, the Millennium Falcon, with Lando Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids onboard, arrived\r\n    to rescue him. As they escaped from Bespin, and the Falcon was faced with the Imperial fleet, Vader\r\n    reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him \"son.\" Skywalker fought tears back, after\r\n    hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the\r\n    truth, just as the Falcon made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h4 id=\"l4l1\">Haunted by the truth</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Haunted by the truth of his parentage, Skywalker found his connection to the Force considerably\r\n        weakened, with his control over it remaining sporadic. Aboard the Falcon, Organa informed him of what\r\n        had happened to Solo. Skywalker wanted to begin searching for his friend immediately, but Organa told\r\n        him that there was more at stake than just Solo\'s life and it would be best to reconvene with the Rebel\r\n        fleet first. With Skywalker agreeing to this plan, the Falcon jumped to hyperspace.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The Falcon arrived at the Rebellion\'s Rendezvous Point Delta-Three in the Mid Rim to find the fleet\'s\r\n        Fourth Division under attack from several Star Destroyers, including the Tarkin\'s Will, which was under\r\n        the leadership of Commander Ellian Zahra. As the Falcon entered the battle, Skywalker volunteered to\r\n        commandeer the ship\'s belly gun, despite his injuries. However, he found it impossible to use with one\r\n        hand, and quickly became frustrated. His anger resulted in him unknowingly using the Force to make\r\n        several of the attacking TIE Fighters crash into one another. With Luke stunned by his sudden show of\r\n        strength, the fleet jumped to hyperspace.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        With the fleet regrouped, Skywalker found a deserted part of the flagship and attempted to contact Yoda\r\n        through the Force. Angry at the Jedi Master\'s refusal to answer, he almost shattered one of the ship\'s\r\n        windows in another frustration-fueled loss of control over his Force abilities. He wondered whether the\r\n        lack of answers from his mentors signified a premature end to his Jedi training, and who he was meant to\r\n        be if not a Jedi.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Organa told Skywalker that he should have a prosthetic hand installed in the Nebulon-B frigate\r\n        Redemption\'s medbay. Although unsure whether it would help his mental state, Skywalker agreed, and\r\n        received the hand as Calrissian and Chewbacca set out to find Solo.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"l5\">The last of the Jedi</h3>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l5l1\">Solo Rescue</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_solo_rescue.jpg\" alt=\"Luke rescue Solo\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Luke rescue Solo\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker returned to Tatooine in <br> order to rescue Solo from Jabba Desilijic Tiure.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    In 4 ABY, Skywalker set in motion the plan to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt due to their failure\r\n    to do so during the Attack on the Executor. Once again, Skywalker returned to Tatooine, and to\r\n    Kenobi\'s hut, wherein he found the missing parts he needed for the construction of his own lightsaber,\r\n    the pieces left to him by Kenobi. While his friends bustled about preparing for the rescue, Skywalker\r\n    retreated into the solitude of a desert cave they had chosen as their rendezvous point. Using the Force\r\n    to assemble the weapon, he brought the kyber crystal inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost\r\n    an extension of himself.\r\n\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Afterwards, Skywalker waited to see if Organa\'s impersonation of Boushh and liberation of Solo was\r\n    successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to\r\n    Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to\r\n    Jabba\'s Palace. Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba\'s Gamorrean guards\r\n    and his majordomo, Bib Fortuna, but the Hutt was not so easily swayed and attempted to feed Skywalker to\r\n    his rancor, which Luke later killed, upsetting Malakili, the Rancor\'s keeper.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Skywalker killed the monster, but Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance\r\n    heroes–including an unfrozen Solo–to death in the Great Pit of Carkoon to be eaten by the sarlacc that\r\n    resided there. However, right before he was put into the pit, Skywalker escaped when R2-D2 shot his\r\n    lightsaber to him and freed the other prisoners on the skiff. A skirmish ensued in which Skywalker\r\n    protected his friends, ending the life of several of Jabba\'s thugs—including Klaatu and Nysad,\r\n    who shot his cyborg hand during the skirmish—and helping Organa escape the Khetanna after she had killed\r\n    the Hutt. After destroying the sail barge, Skywalker and his entire team escaped unscathed through a\r\n    dangerous sandstorm, after which he boarded his X-Wing with R2-D2 and parted ways with the others.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l5l2\">Keeping the promise</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker then returned to Dagobah to complete his training and keep the promise he had made to\r\n        Yoda, but the aged Jedi Master, who had used the Force to prolong his life beyond what was natural,\r\n        had fallen ill and was finally starting to succumb to age. Yoda told Skywalker that he\'d already\r\n        completed all the training he required, but in order to finally become a true Jedi, he needed to\r\n        confront Darth Vader one more time. Having grown less and less sure since the revelation,\r\n        Skywalker feared that it was the truth, Skywalker inquired if Vader was truly his father.\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_ghost_of_kenobi.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Kenobi ghost\" class=\"content_img\"\r\n            title=\"Luke and Ben Kenobi ghost\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker received confirmation from <br> Kenobi that Darth Vader was indeed his father.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <br> <br>\r\n    Skywalker received such confirmation from Yoda, which angered him that they had lied to him for so long,\r\n    but Yoda confessed that he knew that Skywalker\r\n    had not been ready to shoulder the burden of being the child of the Dark Lord of the Sith, to which\r\n    Skywalker expressed his regret that he did not listen to him the first time. After warning him not\r\n    to underestimate the Emperor\'s powers or allow the dark side to take hold of him, and that as \"the last\r\n    of the Jedi\" he had to pass on what he had learned, Yoda made one final revelation to Skywalker before\r\n    he became one with the Force—that there was \"another Skywalker.\"\r\n\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Sensing his turmoil, the spirit of Kenobi appeared before Skywalker, who confronted him for lying about\r\n    his father. Claiming that the good man that Anakin Skywalker had been had died upon his fall to the dark\r\n    side, Kenobi stated that he did not directly lie to him about his father; he was simply telling him what\r\n    happened \"from a certain point of view.\" Skywalker voiced his belief that there was still good within\r\n    his father, and that he could not bring himself to kill him, but Kenobi insisted that he needed to face\r\n    him again in order to restore balance to the Force. Skywalker then asked about the \"other Skywalker,\"\r\n    who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect\r\n    them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was\r\n    Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi. Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother\'s\r\n    identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew\r\n    Skywalker carried too many burdens already.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4 id=\"l5l3\">Adventure on the moon</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested moon of Endor to destroy\r\n        the shield generator that protected the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit, volunteering\r\n        immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above Sullust. As they approached the moon on the stolen\r\n        Lambda-class Imperial shuttle Tydirium, Skywalker sensed Vader\'s presence on the nearby Super Star\r\n        Destroyer Executor and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that\r\n        prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of\r\n        Imperial scout troopers that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on\r\n        speeder bikes. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Upon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the droids went looking for her,\r\n        only to be captured by a tribe of Ewoks. Using the Force to prove C-3PO\'s deific \"magic\", Skywalker\r\n        convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after C-3PO\'s tale of their adventures, the whole group was\r\n        accepted as a part of the village. However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the\r\n        Force and landed on the moon, and knew that he had to confront Vader. He quietly slipped away from\r\n        the celebration, but Organa noticed that he had left and followed him. He informed her of what he was\r\n        planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last\r\n        hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Organa was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to\r\n        him that, somehow, she\'d always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but\r\n        Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Eventually encountering an Imperial patrol and willingly surrendering himself to Commander Igar,\r\n        Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring\r\n        to him as \"Anakin Skywalker,\" but Vader harshly denounced his former name. Although he managed to\r\n        make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him, Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner\r\n        of the Emperor as he was escorted to his throne room onboard the Death Star.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h4 id=\"l5l4\">The final duel</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_DeathStarDuel.jpg\" alt=\"Duel on Death Star\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Duel on Death Star\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker confronted Vader on the second Death Star, <br>\r\n            believing he could redeem his father in spite <br>\r\n            of the Emperor\'s control over him.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    As he was brought before the Emperor, the Dark Lord of the Sith repeatedly told the young Jedi that he\r\n    would fall to the dark side just as easily as Vader had, and let him know that he had purposely allowed\r\n    the Alliance to discover the second Death Star\'s location in order to lure them into a trap and finish\r\n    them off once and for all.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    In order to temper Skywalker\'s negative emotions, Sidious forced him to watch as the Imperial Fleet\r\n    engaged the Rebels. He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though\r\n    Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the\r\n    destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down\r\n    the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous\r\n    encounter on Bespin (where Vader was largely able to dominate the proceedings, throughout), this time\r\n    the pair would fight as equals.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    After successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before\r\n    regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and\r\n    attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight\r\n    Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    A cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to\r\n    such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his\r\n    apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he\'d cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and\r\n    in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker\r\n    tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a\r\n    Jedi like his father before him.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Infuriated that his plan to corrupt Luke had gone up in smoke, Sidious declared that, if Skywalker would\r\n    not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of Force lightning against him. Unprepared\r\n    for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail. During the Sith master\r\n    assault on the Jedi Knight, Vader had gotten back to his feet and returned to his master\'s side, and\r\n    Luke begged his father to save him.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Eventually, seeing his son in such terrible pain became too great for Vader to bear any longer, and in\r\n    that moment, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was gone, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker was reborn. In a\r\n    snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the\r\n    shaft to his death. In doing so, however, he turned Sidious\'s lethal Force lightning on himself,\r\n    irreparably damaging his life-supporting armor.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h4 id=\"l5l5\">Anakin redemption</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_Anakinredeemed.jpg\" alt=\"Anakin redemption\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Anakin redemption\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker confronted Vader on the second Death Star, <br>\r\n            believing he could redeem his father in spite <br>\r\n            of the Emperor\'s control over him.<br>\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    Luke carried Anakin to Imperial shuttle ST 321, where his father asked him to remove his breathing\r\n    mask. Though Luke was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Anakin told him\r\n    that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his\r\n    own eyes. Luke relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father\'s real face for the first and only\r\n    time. Anakin then encouraged Luke to leave him and save himself. Though Luke was insistent on saving\r\n    Anakin, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with\r\n    his last words, told him to tell Leia that he\'d been right about him before passing away. At the\r\n    cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Anakin Skywalker had finally fulfilled his destiny as\r\n    the Chosen One and had brought balance to the Force. Similarly, by helping his father to return to\r\n    the light side of the Force by offering him unconditional love and refusing to fight, destroy, or let\r\n    his anger eclipse the goodness in his heart, Luke Skywalker had achieved what Anakin and the whole Jedi\r\n    Order failed to achieve upon being twisted by the Clone Wars: to forgive a monster and reveal a\r\n    man.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    Skywalker took his father\'s body on board the shuttle and escaped just before the Death Star\'s\r\n    destruction, when he was almost intercepted by Green Squadron\'s Shara Bey, who proceeded to cover\r\n    him from TIE interceptors after he identified himself.Back on Endor, Skywalker cremated his\r\n    father\'s armor (his body had vanished) in the manner of a Jedi\'s funeral, and then joined his friends\r\n    and sister in the celebration. It was during this moment of celebration that Skywalker saw the onlooking\r\n    Force spirits of Kenobi, Yoda, and his father, looking at him in approval and with a sense of peace.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h2 id=\"anchor2\">Personality and traits</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for\r\n        his present surroundings, and even a bit brash. Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and\r\n        often had little regard for his own personal safety. According to Yoda, he had a \"gaping need\" for a\r\n        connection to his father and to have a family. Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer\r\n        with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained \"about\r\n        everything\" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine. He also acknowledged his scarce talent at\r\n        lying, a trait that many people could infer. He once confided in Leia that he felt Tatooine had\r\n        never felt like a home to him.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        As his skills in the Force progressed, and especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker\r\n        became more patient and seasoned. He was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years; however,\r\n        he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone, and believing that\r\n        Vader was redeemable. He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of\r\n        endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else\'s life, as his father would throughout the\r\n        Clone Wars. Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite\r\n        likely danger.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h2 id=\"anchor3\">Powers and abilities</h2>\r\n    <h3 id=\"a3l1\">Lightsaber abilities</h3>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_duel_lightsaber.jpg\" alt=\"Duel with Vader\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Luke duel with Vader\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker was an accomplished duelist <br> who triumphed over his father, Darth Vader.\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Though he received little training, Luke Skywalker had a natural talent for lightsaber combat. Luke\'s\r\n        initial training with the weapon of the Jedi came during a brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a\r\n        training remote on the way to Alderaan, where he learned the initial position and the four defensive\r\n        postures. Though his level proved inadequate during his first, but brief duel against Darth Vader on\r\n        Cymoon 1, his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin, and culminated with him besting the\r\n        Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Like most Jedi, Skywalker was adept at redirecting blaster fire. During his mission to Rodia, he tried\r\n        his hand at Jar\'Kai for the first time with his and Huulik\'s lightsaber. Although he killed a ghest, he\r\n        admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of \"panicked reflexes and really good weapons.\" He\r\n        received further training from the \"Gamemaster,\" a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art\r\n        of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt\'s MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory\r\n        abilities.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        After a brief time of training with Yoda, Skywalker revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin.\r\n        Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel and managed to hold his own for much of the duel, wounding\r\n        Vader in the shoulder, impressing the Dark Lord with his skill, though Vader ultimately bested his son\r\n        and cut off his hand, proving his superiority. Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during\r\n        the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the\r\n        execution skiff and Jabba\'s sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Skywalker showed his\r\n        improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to\r\n        fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Leia to the dark side, an\r\n        enraged Skywalker unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"a3l2\">Force powers</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Like his father, Skywalker possessed a uniquely powerful connection to the Force, and became one of the\r\n        most powerful Force wielders in galactic history. Indeed, Darth Sidious believed that Skywalker was\r\n        strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith. Most of Luke\'s understanding of the Force came from his\r\n        own research, exploration, and experience as he only had a few days Kenobi\'s mentorship before his\r\n        demise, Yoda\'s one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi\'s sporadic guidance from\r\n        beyond the Netherworld of the Force.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        After learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to sense through it, and took the habit\r\n        of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware\r\n        of his surroundings. In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father, and\r\n        telepathically calling his sister. He was capable of seeing and hearing those who had become one with\r\n        the Force. By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a\r\n        shot that many thought was impossible.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        After obtaining Huulik\'s lightsaber and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on\r\n        his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to\r\n        learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.\r\n        <br>\r\n        By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though\r\n        not without difficulty. Under Yoda\'s training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to\r\n        levitate several objects at once while meditating. Shortly after the revelation that Darth Vader was his\r\n        father, Luke Skywalker lashed out with the Force, hurtling a squadron of Tie Fighters into each other.\r\n        In another outburst, he accidentally cracked the window of a starship.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker eventually learned other uses, such as mind control techniques. He was also proficient in\r\n        being able to hurl foes away, or damage all nearby foes. Luke could use the Force to make great leaps.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3 id=\"a3l3\">Other abilities</h3>\r\n    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"//raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentSevaille/starWarsProject/master/src/main/resources/static/IMG/ls_xwing.jpg\" alt=\"Luke\'s X-Wing\" class=\"content_img\" title=\"Luke\'s X-Wing\">\r\n        <figcaption>Skywalker, whose father was considered the best <br>\r\n            pilot in the galaxy, flew the X-wing starfighter <br> that destroyed the Death Star.\r\n        </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying\r\n        the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo). He also\r\n        managed to destroy an Interdictor vessel on his own while piloting the Desert Jewel, although he\r\n        acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the\r\n        nick of time. He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease,\r\n        outmaneuvering an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor that was trying to get a lock on him. In fact, Skywalker had a\r\n        talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        He was a native speaker of Galactic Basic Standard, and although Skywalker could not understand\r\n        Shyriiwook, he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca\'s moods by his tone and expression before the\r\n        Battle of Yavin. After decades of missions with R2, Skywalker was reasonably fluent in droidspeak.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        Skywalker was adept in unarmed combat. He demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a\r\n        few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground. <br>\r\n        Shortly afterwards he found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shadaa.\r\n        Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the\r\n        rest.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        <br><br>\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','Luke Skywalker');
